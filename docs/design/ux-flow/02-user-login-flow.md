# User Login Flow - Identity Provider

## Overview
This document defines the user experience for returning users authenticating with the Identity Provider. The flow emphasizes security, convenience, and seamless integration with client applications while maintaining user trust and providing clear feedback.

**Related Documents**:
- [UX Standards and Guidelines](./00-ux-standards.md) - Shared accessibility and localization requirements
- [Technical Implementation](../../architecture/auth-flows-technical.md) - Security and integration details

## User Goals
- Quickly and securely access their account
- Seamlessly continue to intended destination
- Maintain security without excessive friction
- Understand authentication status and options

## Entry Points
1. **Direct login**: User visits IDP login page directly
2. **SSO redirect**: User redirected from client application
3. **Session expired**: User session timeout requiring re-authentication
4. **Password reset**: User completing password reset process
5. **Account recovery**: User recovering compromised account

## Primary Login Flow

### Step 1: Authentication Method Selection
**Screen**: Login Landing
**User Action**: Choose authentication method

**Available Methods**:
- Email + Password (primary)
- Social login (Google, GitHub, Apple)
- Magic link (passwordless)
- Biometric authentication (mobile)
- Two-factor authentication (if enabled)

**Behavioral Logic**:
- Remember last-used authentication method
- Show available methods based on account setup
- Display clear security indicators
- Provide "Forgot password?" option prominently

**Interaction States**:
- Default: Show all available methods
- Loading: Disable form during authentication
- Error: Show method-specific error messages
- Success: Immediate redirect or confirmation

### Step 2: Credential Input
**Screen**: Authentication Form
**Required Fields** (varies by method):
- Email address (for email/password)
- Password (for email/password)
- 2FA code (if enabled)

**Behavioral Logic**:
- Email field auto-suggestion from browser
- Password visibility toggle
- Remember device option
- Automatic 2FA detection

**Security Features**:
- Rate limiting after failed attempts
- CAPTCHA for suspicious activity
- Account lockout protection
- Secure password transmission

### Step 3: Two-Factor Authentication (if enabled)
**Screen**: 2FA Verification
**Authentication Methods**:
- SMS code verification
- Authenticator app (TOTP)
- Email verification code
- Hardware security keys
- Backup codes

**User Experience**:
- Clear instructions for each method
- Easy method switching
- Backup code access
- "Trust this device" option

**Edge Cases**:
- Lost device scenarios
- Code not received
- Invalid/expired codes
- Multiple 2FA methods available

### Step 4: Session Establishment
**Screen**: Login Success
**User Action**: Automatic redirect or confirmation

**Process Flow**:
1. Establish secure session
2. Update last login timestamp
3. Redirect to intended destination
4. Initialize user context

**Security Measures**:
- Secure session tokens
- Session timeout configuration
- Device fingerprinting
- Suspicious activity detection

## Alternative Authentication Flows

### Social Login Flow
**Process**:
1. User clicks social provider button
2. Redirect to provider authentication
3. Provider consent screen (if first time)
4. Redirect back with authorization code
5. Account linking or creation
6. Session establishment

**Provider Integration**:
- Seamless social authentication experience
- Clear permission requests and scope explanation
- Consistent profile data handling
- Account linking with existing accounts when appropriate

### Magic Link Flow
**User Experience**:
1. User enters email address
2. Clear confirmation message with email sending status
3. Email with clear call-to-action link
4. Automatic authentication on link click
5. Welcome back confirmation

**User Communication**:
- Clear explanation of magic link benefits
- Email delivery confirmation and troubleshooting
- Link expiration communication (15 minutes)
- Fallback to password login if needed

### Biometric Authentication
**User Experience** (Mobile/Desktop):
1. Clear biometric prompt with fallback options
2. Intuitive biometric interface
3. Immediate feedback on authentication status
4. Quick session establishment
5. Clear success confirmation

**Supported Methods and UX**:
- Fingerprint: Touch sensor with visual guidance
- Face ID: Proper camera positioning prompts
- Voice: Clear audio instructions and privacy notes
- Hardware keys: Step-by-step connection guidance
