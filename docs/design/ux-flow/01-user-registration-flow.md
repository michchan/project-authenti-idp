# User Registration Flow - Identity Provider

## Overview
This document outlines the complete user journey for first-time users registering with the Identity Provider service. The flow prioritizes simplicity, security, and trust-building while ensuring proper consent and verification.

- [Technical Implementation](../architecture/auth-flows-technical.md) - Security and integration details

## User Goals
- Create a secure account with minimal friction
- Understand what data is being collected and why
- Feel confident about privacy and security measures
- Complete verification quickly and easily

## Entry Points
1. **Direct registration**: User visits IDP registration page directly
2. **SSO redirect**: User attempts to access a client app and is redirected to register
3. **Developer invitation**: User invited by app developer to test integration
4. **Marketing referral**: User arrives via marketing campaigns or referrals

## Primary Registration Flow

### Step 1: Registration Method Selection
**Screen**: Registration Landing
**User Action**: Choose registration method
**Options**:
- Email + Password
- Social login (Google, GitHub, Apple)
- Magic link (passwordless)

**Behavioral Logic**:
- Display clear value proposition
- Show security badges/certifications
- Present privacy-first messaging
- Include "Already have an account?" link

**Accessibility**: See [UX Standards](./00-ux-standards.md#accessibility-standards) for complete requirements

### Step 2: Information Collection
**Screen**: Registration Form
**Required Fields**:
- Email address (primary identifier)
- Password (if not using social/magic link)
- Display name
- Consent checkboxes

**Optional Fields**:
- Profile picture
- Phone number (for 2FA)

**Behavioral Logic**:
- Real-time validation with helpful error messages
- Password strength indicator
- Email format validation
- Duplicate account detection

**Interaction States**:
- Loading: Show spinner during validation
- Error: Inline validation messages
- Success: Green checkmarks for valid fields

### Step 3: Consent and Privacy
**Screen**: Consent Management
**Required Consents**:

### Step 4: Email Verification

**User Action**: Check email and click verification link

**Process Flow**:
1. Send verification email immediately
2. Show "check your email" confirmation
3. Provide resend option (with rate limiting)
4. Allow editing email if incorrect

**Edge Cases**:
- Email not received (resend, check spam)
- Wrong email address (allow correction)
- Expired verification link (generate new one)
- Multiple verification attempts

### Step 5: Account Activation
**Screen**: Welcome/Profile Setup
**User Action**: Complete optional profile setup

**Profile Options**:
- Upload profile picture
- Set timezone preference
- Configure notification preferences
- Set up two-factor authentication

**Behavioral Logic**:

- Clear value proposition for each feature
- Immediate account usability
