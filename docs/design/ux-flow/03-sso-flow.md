# SSO Flow - Identity Provider

## Overview
This document outlines the Single Sign-On (SSO) user experience when users access client applications through the Identity Provider. The flow emphasizes seamless authentication, clear consent management, and secure token exchange while maintaining user control and transparency.

## User Goals
- Access client applications without repeated authentication
- Understand what data is being shared with applications
- Maintain control over application permissions
- Experience seamless navigation between applications

## SSO Flow Types

### 1. Fresh Authentication Flow
**Scenario**: User not currently authenticated with IDP
**Entry Point**: Client application redirect

#### Step 1: Initial Redirect
**User Action**: User clicks "Login with [IDP Name]" or similar
**System Action**: Client app redirects to IDP with parameters:
- `client_id`: Application identifier
- `redirect_uri`: Return URL
- `scope`: Requested permissions
- `state`: CSRF protection token
- `response_type`: Authorization flow type

#### Step 2: Authentication Required
**Screen**: IDP Login Interface
**User Experience**:
- Branded login screen with client app context
- Clear indication of which app is requesting access
- Standard authentication options (email/password, social, etc.)
- "Cancel" option to return to client app

**Context Display**:
- Client application name and logo
- Requesting permissions/scopes
- Data sharing explanation
- Privacy and security assurances

#### Step 3: Consent Management
**Screen**: Permission Request
**User Action**: Review and approve requested permissions

**Consent Details**:
- Specific data access requests
- Permission duration
- Data usage explanation
- Option to modify permissions

**Behavioral Logic**:
- First-time consent for new applications
- Updated consent for scope changes
- Remember consent for trusted apps
- Clear revocation process

#### Step 4: Authorization Grant
**System Action**: Generate authorization code
**User Experience**: Automatic redirect to client application
**Security Measures**:
- Short-lived authorization codes (5 minutes)
- PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) support
- State parameter validation
- Secure redirect URI validation

### 2. Existing Session Flow
**Scenario**: User already authenticated with IDP
**Entry Point**: Client application redirect with active session

#### Step 1: Session Detection
**System Action**: Detect existing valid session
**User Experience**: 
- No additional authentication required
- Immediate consent check
- Seamless redirection

#### Step 2: Consent Verification
**Decision Points**:
- **Previously consented**: Direct authorization
- **New permissions**: Show consent screen
- **Expired consent**: Re-request permissions
- **Revoked access**: Request fresh consent

#### Step 3: Immediate Authorization
**User Experience**: 
- Brief loading screen with progress indicator
- Clear messaging about redirect process
- Option to cancel/logout if desired

### 3. Step-Up Authentication Flow
**Scenario**: Application requires higher security level
**Entry Point**: Standard SSO with elevated security requirements

#### Step 1: Security Level Check
**System Evaluation**:
- Current authentication strength
- Time since last authentication
- Risk assessment factors
- Application security requirements

#### Step 2: Additional Authentication
**Screen**: Enhanced Security Request
**Requirements** (as needed):
- Multi-factor authentication
- Password re-entry
- Biometric verification
- Hardware security key

**User Communication**:
- Clear explanation of why additional auth is needed
- Security benefit messaging
- Streamlined additional authentication
- Option to decline and return to app

## Consent Management System

### Permission Categories
**Profile Information**:
- Basic profile (name, email)
- Extended profile (photo, phone)
- Demographic information
- Account preferences

**Application Access**:
- Read-only access
- Write permissions
- Offline access
- Admin capabilities

**Data Sharing**:
- Analytics and usage data
- Behavioral information
- Integration data
- Third-party sharing

### Consent Interface Design
**Screen**: Permission Request
**Layout**:
```
[App Logo] wants to access your [IDP Name] account

The following permissions are requested:
☐ Access your basic profile information
  ├ Name, email address, profile picture
  └ Why: To personalize your experience

☐ Read your account preferences  
  ├ Language, timezone, notification settings
  └ Why: To configure app settings automatically

☐ Keep you signed in
  ├ Maintain login session for 30 days
  └ Why: To avoid repeated logins

[Decline] [Accept Selected] [Accept All]
```

**Behavioral Logic**:
- Granular permission selection
- Clear explanation for each permission
- Default selections favor user privacy
- Easy permission modification

### Consent Persistence
**Storage Requirements**:
- User consent records
- Permission scope tracking
- Consent timestamp logging
- Revocation history

**Management Features**:
- View all connected applications
- Modify existing permissions
- Revoke access completely
- Download consent history

## Token Management

### Authorization Code Flow
**Process**:
1. User authorization at IDP
2. Authorization code generation
3. Client app receives code
4. Backend token exchange
5. Access/refresh token delivery

**Security Measures**:
- HTTPS-only communication
- Short authorization code lifetime
- One-time code usage
- PKCE implementation

### Token Types
**Access Tokens**:
- JWT or opaque token format
- Short lifetime (15 minutes - 1 hour)
- Scope-limited permissions
- Audience validation

**Refresh Tokens**:
- Secure, long-lived tokens
- Rotation on each use
- Revocation capability
- Device binding

**ID Tokens** (OpenID Connect):
- User identity information
- Signed JWT format
- Standard claims support
- Custom claim inclusion
