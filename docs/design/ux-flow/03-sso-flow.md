# SSO Flow - Identity Provider

## Overview
This document outlines the Single Sign-On (SSO) user experience when users access client applications through the Identity Provider. The flow emphasizes seamless authentication, clear consent management, and user control while maintaining transparency and trust.

**Related Documents**:

- [Technical Implementation](../../architecture/auth-flows-technical.md) - Security and technical integration details

## User Goals
- Access client applications without repeated authentication
- Understand what data is being shared with applications
- Maintain control over application permissions
- Experience seamless navigation between applications

## SSO Flow Types

### 1. Fresh Authentication Flow
**Scenario**: User not currently authenticated with IDP
**Entry Point**: Client application redirect

#### Step 1: Initial Redirect
**User Action**: User clicks "Login with [IDP Name]" or similar
**User Experience**: 
- Clear indication that user is being redirected to trusted identity provider
- Loading screen with progress indication during redirect
- Branded transition showing both client app and IDP logos
- Cancel option available during redirect process

#### Step 2: Authentication Required
**Screen**: IDP Login Interface
**User Experience**:
- Branded login screen with client app context
- Clear indication of which app is requesting access
- Standard authentication options (email/password, social, etc.)
- "Cancel" option to return to client app

**Context Display**:
- Client application name and logo
- Requesting permissions/scopes
- Data sharing explanation
- Privacy and security assurances

#### Step 3: Consent Management
**Screen**: Permission Request
**User Action**: Review and approve requested permissions

**Consent Details**:
- Specific data access requests
- Permission duration
- Data usage explanation
- Option to modify permissions

**Behavioral Logic**:
- First-time consent for new applications
- Updated consent for scope changes
- Remember consent for trusted apps
- Clear revocation process

#### Step 4: Authorization Grant
**User Experience**: 
- Brief confirmation screen showing successful authorization
- Clear messaging about redirect back to application
- Loading indicator during redirect process
- Option to cancel and return to IDP if redirect fails

**Technical Details**: See [Authentication Flows Technical Documentation](../../architecture/auth-flows-technical.md#sso-flow---technical-requirements) for security measures, token generation, and validation requirements.

### 2. Existing Session Flow
**Scenario**: User already authenticated with IDP
**Entry Point**: Client application redirect with active session

#### Step 1: Session Detection
**System Action**: Detect existing valid session
**User Experience**: 
- No additional authentication required
- Immediate consent check
- Seamless redirection

#### Step 2: Consent Verification
**Decision Points**:
- **Previously consented**: Direct authorization
- **New permissions**: Show consent screen
- **Expired consent**: Re-request permissions
- **Revoked access**: Request fresh consent

#### Step 3: Immediate Authorization
**User Experience**: 
- Brief loading screen with progress indicator
- Clear messaging about redirect process
- Option to cancel/logout if desired

### 3. Step-Up Authentication Flow
**Scenario**: Application requires higher security level
**Entry Point**: Standard SSO with elevated security requirements

#### Step 1: Security Level Check
**System Evaluation**:
- Current authentication strength
- Time since last authentication
- Risk assessment factors
- Application security requirements

#### Step 2: Additional Authentication
**Screen**: Enhanced Security Request
**Requirements** (as needed):
- Multi-factor authentication
- Password re-entry
- Biometric verification
- Hardware security key

**User Communication**:
- Clear explanation of why additional auth is needed
- Security benefit messaging
- Streamlined additional authentication
- Option to decline and return to app

## Consent Management System

### Consent Interface Design
**Screen**: Permission Request
**Layout**:
```
[App Logo] wants to access your [IDP Name] account

The following permissions are requested:
☐ Access your basic profile information
  ├ Name, email address, profile picture
  └ Why: To personalize your experience

☐ Read your account preferences  
  ├ Language, timezone, notification settings
  └ Why: To configure app settings automatically

☐ Keep you signed in
  ├ Maintain login session for 30 days
  └ Why: To avoid repeated logins

[Decline] [Accept Selected] [Accept All]
```

**Behavioral Logic**:
