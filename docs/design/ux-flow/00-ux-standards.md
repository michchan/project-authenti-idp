# UX Standards and Guidelines - Identity Provider

## Overview
This document defines shared UX standards, accessibility requirements, and localization considerations that apply across all user flows in the Identity Provider platform. Reference this document to avoid repetition in individual flow specifications.

## Accessibility Standards

### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance
All user interfaces must meet WCAG 2.1 AA compliance standards:

**Keyboard Navigation**:
- All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- Logical tab order throughout interfaces
- Visible focus indicators (minimum 2px outline)
- Skip links for main content areas
- No keyboard traps

**Screen Reader Compatibility**:
- Semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy
- Clear form labels and instructions
- Error message announcements
- Progress indication for screen readers
- Alternative text for visual elements
- Live regions for dynamic content updates

**Visual Requirements**:
- Color contrast minimum 4.5:1 for normal text
- Color contrast minimum 3:1 for large text and UI components
- Information not conveyed by color alone
- High contrast mode support
- Scalable text up to 200% without loss of functionality

**Motor Accessibility**:
- Touch targets minimum 44px on mobile
- Click targets minimum 24px on desktop
- Sufficient spacing between interactive elements
- Support for assistive devices

### Assistive Technology Support
**Form Design**:
- Clear, descriptive labels for all form fields
- Required field indicators (not color-only)
- Inline validation with clear error messaging
- Progress indicators for multi-step flows
- Autocomplete attributes where appropriate

**Interactive Elements**:
- Button purposes clearly identified
- Link destinations clearly described
- Loading states announced to screen readers
- Error states announced immediately
- Success confirmations provided

## Localization Standards

### Multi-language Support Framework
**Text Content**:
- All user-facing text externalized for translation
- Support for text expansion (up to 30% longer in some languages)
- Proper handling of text direction (LTR/RTL)
- Cultural date, time, and number formats
- Currency localization where applicable

**Interface Adaptations**:
- Right-to-left language support (Arabic, Hebrew)
- Character encoding support (UTF-8)
- Font selection for various scripts
- Input method editor (IME) support
- Locale-specific form validation

**Cultural Considerations**:
- Color meanings vary by culture
- Icon symbolism awareness
- Cultural privacy expectations
- Regional compliance requirements
- Local contact methods and support hours

### Regional Compliance Framework
**Data Protection**:
- GDPR compliance (European Union)
- CCPA compliance (California)
- Data residency requirements
- Cross-border data transfer protocols
- Right to be forgotten implementation

**Authentication Methods**:
- Regional identity verification standards
- Local authentication preferences
- Government ID integration where required
- Regional security requirements
- Cultural authentication patterns

## Mobile Experience Standards

### Responsive Design Requirements
**Breakpoint Strategy**:
- Mobile: 320px - 767px
- Tablet: 768px - 1023px  
- Desktop: 1024px+
- Large Desktop: 1440px+

**Touch Optimization**:
- Minimum 44px touch targets
- Adequate spacing between touch elements
- Thumb-friendly navigation placement
- Swipe gesture support where appropriate
- Haptic feedback integration

**Performance Standards**:
- First Contentful Paint under 1.5 seconds
- Largest Contentful Paint under 2.5 seconds
- Cumulative Layout Shift under 0.1
- First Input Delay under 100ms
- Progressive loading strategies

### Mobile-Specific Features
**Device Integration**:
- Biometric authentication support
- Camera integration for QR codes
- Secure storage utilization
- Push notification support
- Deep linking capabilities

**Offline Capabilities**:
- Graceful offline detection
- Cached authentication state
- Offline-first critical paths
- Sync when connection restored
- Clear offline messaging

## Error Handling Standards

### Error Message Framework
All error messages should follow this structure:
1. **What happened**: Clear problem description
2. **Why it happened**: Context when helpful (avoid technical jargon)
3. **What to do next**: Specific, actionable steps
4. **How to get help**: Support options
5. **How to prevent**: Future prevention tips (when relevant)

### Error Severity Classification
**Critical**: System failures, security breaches, data loss
**High**: Authentication failures, service unavailable
**Medium**: Validation errors, temporary connectivity issues
**Low**: Warnings, informational messages, helpful tips

### Error Recovery Patterns
**Multiple Recovery Paths**:
- Primary recovery action (most likely to succeed)
- Alternative recovery methods
- Escalation to human support
- Return to safe state option

**Progressive Error Disclosure**:
- Start with simple, common solutions
- Reveal technical details only if requested
- Provide error codes for support reference
- Offer increasing levels of assistance

## Loading and Progress Standards

### Loading State Patterns
**Immediate Feedback**:
- Loading indicators appear within 100ms
- Progress bars for operations over 2 seconds
- Step-by-step progress for multi-stage processes
- Cancel options for long-running operations

**Progressive Loading**:
- Critical content loads first
- Secondary content loads progressively
- Skeleton screens for predictable layouts
- Graceful degradation if resources fail

### Timeout and Retry Logic
**User-Facing Timeouts**:
- Form submissions: 30 seconds
- Authentication: 15 seconds
- General API calls: 10 seconds  
- Real-time updates: 5 seconds

**Retry Strategies**:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Manual retry options for users
- Clear indication of retry attempts
- Fallback to cached data when appropriate

## Security and Privacy UX

### Transparent Security Practices
**Security Messaging**:
- Clear, non-technical security explanations
- Visual security indicators (badges, certificates)
- Progress tracking for security setup
- Educational content about security features

**Privacy Controls**:
- Granular privacy settings
- Clear data usage explanations
- Easy consent withdrawal
- Regular privacy setting reminders

### Trust Building Elements
**Credibility Indicators**:
- Professional, consistent visual design
- Clear contact information and support
- Transparent about data usage
- Security certifications displayed
- Regular security updates communicated

## Performance and Analytics Standards

### User Experience Metrics
**Core Web Vitals**:
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): <2.5s
- First Input Delay (FID): <100ms
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): <0.1

**User Journey Metrics**:
- Task completion rates
- Time to complete critical flows  
- Error recovery success rates
- User satisfaction scores
- Drop-off points in flows

### Privacy-Respecting Analytics
**Data Collection**:
- Minimal data collection for UX improvement
- Anonymized user behavior tracking
- Opt-in for detailed analytics
- Regular data retention cleanup
- Transparent about what data is collected

## Implementation Guidelines

### Cross-Reference Usage
When creating individual flow documents:
- Reference this document for shared standards
- Focus on flow-specific interactions and decision points
- Avoid repeating accessibility or localization details
- Link to relevant sections in this document
- Highlight any flow-specific exceptions to these standards

### Maintenance and Updates
This standards document should be:
- Updated when new accessibility guidelines emerge
- Reviewed quarterly for relevance and completeness
- Versioned when significant changes are made
- Communicated to all team members when updated
- Used as checklist during design reviews

For specific implementation details on any of these standards, consult the respective technical documentation in `/docs/architecture/` or reach out to the development team.
