## Error Handling Principles

### User-Centered Error Design
**Core Principles**:
- Clear, non-technical language
- Specific, actionable error messages
- Multiple recovery path options
- Emotional consideration in messaging
- Prevention over correction

**Error Message Framework**:
1. **What happened**: Clear problem description
2. **Why it happened**: Context when helpful
3. **What to do next**: Specific action steps
4. **How to get help**: Support options
5. **How to prevent**: Future prevention tips

### Error Severity Classification
**Critical Errors**: System failures, security breaches, data loss
**High Severity**: Authentication failures, service unavailable
**Medium Severity**: Validation errors, temporary issues
**Low Severity**: Warnings, informational messages
