# Authenti IDP - MVP Roadmap

## MVP Scope & Timeline

**Target Timeline**: 3-4 months
**Success Criteria**: Working IDP with sample application demonstrating core functionality

## Phase 1: Core Authentication System (Month 1-2)

### Deliverables
- User registration and login functionality
- Secure token generation and validation
- Basic user profile management
- Password reset capabilities
- Email verification system

### Success Criteria
- Users can successfully register, login, and manage basic profile
- Secure authentication tokens generated and validated
- Email-based account verification working
- Basic security measures implemented (rate limiting, password policies)

## Phase 2: IDP Integration Layer (Month 2-3)

### Deliverables
- OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect protocol implementation
- Developer dashboard for application management
- API for application registration and configuration
- SDK/libraries for common integration patterns
- Documentation and integration guides

### Success Criteria
- Third-party applications can successfully integrate authentication
- Developers can register and configure applications through dashboard
- Complete authentication flow working end-to-end
- Clear documentation enabling 2-hour integration time

## Phase 3: Sample Application & Demo (Month 3-4)

### Deliverables
- Sample web application demonstrating IDP integration
- Multi-application demo showing cross-product authentication
- Developer onboarding flow and documentation
- Basic analytics dashboard for user activity

### Success Criteria
- Working demo showcasing value proposition
- Sample application serves as integration reference
- New developers can complete integration following documentation
- Basic user activity insights available to application owners

## MVP Feature Set

### Core Features (Must Have)
- User registration/login with email and password
- Secure session management and token validation
- OAuth 2.0 authorization flow for third-party applications
- Basic user profile management (name, email, basic attributes)
- Application registration and management dashboard
- Integration SDKs for JavaScript/Node.js, React, and Next.js
- Email verification and password reset functionality

### Enhanced Features (Should Have)
- Social login integration (Google, GitHub)
- Role-based access control basics
- User activity logging and basic analytics
- Multi-factor authentication (email-based)
- API rate limiting and security measures
- Responsive web interfaces for all user-facing components

### Future Features (Nice to Have)
- Mobile SDK support
- Advanced user attribute management
- Cross-application user analytics
- Advanced security features (device management, suspicious activity detection)
- Webhook notifications for user events
- Advanced role and permission management

## Resource Allocation

### Development Ownership
- **Backend Engineering**: Core authentication system, APIs, security implementation
- **Frontend Engineering**: User interfaces, developer dashboard, sample applications
- **DevOps/Platform**: Infrastructure setup, deployment pipeline, monitoring
- **Product Management**: Requirements definition, user testing, documentation

### Technology Evaluation Priorities
1. **Authentication Framework**: Evaluate existing open-source solutions vs. custom build
2. **Database Solution**: User data storage with zero-cost options for small scale
3. **Hosting Platform**: Free tier options that can scale (Vercel, Netlify, Railway)
4. **Email Service**: Free tier email providers for verification and notifications
5. **Monitoring**: Basic error tracking and performance monitoring solutions

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Security Implementation**: Leverage established libraries and frameworks rather than custom crypto
- **Scalability**: Choose technologies with clear scaling paths from free to paid tiers
- **Integration Complexity**: Prioritize standard protocols (OAuth 2.0) over custom solutions

### Business Risks
- **Cost Overrun**: Strict monitoring of service usage with alerts before free tier limits
- **User Adoption**: Early user feedback integration and rapid iteration cycles
- **Competition**: Focus on unique value proposition of zero-cost for small scale

## Success Gates

### End of Month 2
- Core authentication system functional with basic security measures
- Initial integration API available for testing
- Technical feasibility proven for zero-cost operation

### End of Month 3
- Complete OAuth 2.0 flow working with external applications
- Developer dashboard functional for application management
- Integration documentation complete and tested

### End of Month 4 (MVP Complete)
- Sample application demonstrates full functionality
- At least 3 beta developers successfully integrated
- All MVP features tested and documented
- Clear path to Phase 1 expansion identified
