# Spike: Technology Stack Evaluation for Cost-Effective IDP

## Spike Objective

Evaluate technology options that enable zero-cost operation for small-scale IDP service while maintaining security, reliability, and scalability potential. Focus on solutions with generous free tiers and clear scaling paths.

## Business Context

The IDP service must operate at zero cost for applications with <100 monthly active users while providing enterprise-grade security and user experience. This constraint requires careful selection of technologies that offer substantial free tiers and cost-effective scaling.

## Key Evaluation Criteria

### Cost Effectiveness (Primary)
- Free tier sufficient for MVP and initial growth
- Predictable pricing model for scaling
- No surprise costs or hidden fees
- Clear usage monitoring and alerting

### Technical Requirements (Primary)
- Security appropriate for authentication service
- Performance adequate for target user scale
- Integration complexity suitable for small teams
- Maintenance overhead manageable with limited resources

### Scalability Considerations (Secondary)
- Clear path from free to paid tiers
- Performance characteristics under growth
- Feature availability across pricing tiers
- Migration complexity if platform changes needed

## Evaluation Methodology

### Phase 1: Research and Documentation (1 week)
- Document free tier limits and restrictions for each option
- Assess technical fit for IDP requirements
- Review security and compliance documentation
- Estimate integration effort for top options

### Phase 2: Proof of Concept Implementation (1-2 weeks)
- Build minimal authentication flow with top 2-3 technology combinations
- Test performance under simulated load
- Validate security configuration options
- Measure development velocity and complexity

### Phase 3: Cost Modeling and Decision (1 week)
- Project costs across different user growth scenarios
- Assess total cost of ownership including development time
- Evaluate vendor lock-in risks and mitigation strategies
- Make final technology stack recommendation

## Success Criteria
