# Epic: Core Authentication System

## Problem Statement

Small-scale application developers need a secure, reliable authentication system but lack the resources to implement enterprise-grade security measures themselves. Building authentication from scratch is time-consuming, error-prone, and diverts focus from core product features.

## Business Value

### Primary Value
- **Time Savings**: Eliminates 30-40% of typical application development time spent on authentication
- **Security Assurance**: Provides enterprise-grade security without requiring security expertise
- **Cost Efficiency**: Enables zero-cost authentication for small-scale applications

### Secondary Value
- **Faster Time-to-Market**: Applications can launch sooner without authentication implementation delays
- **Reduced Risk**: Minimizes security vulnerabilities from custom authentication implementations
- **Developer Experience**: Consistent authentication patterns across multiple applications

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- Solo developers building multiple small applications
- Small teams (2-5 people) managing application portfolios
- Product managers seeking to optimize development resources

### User Needs
- Secure user registration and login functionality
- Protection against common security vulnerabilities
- Simple integration with minimal configuration
- Reliable session management across applications

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success
- Users can register new accounts with email verification
- Secure login process with proper session management
- Password reset functionality available
- Basic user profile management capabilities
- Protection against common attacks (brute force, SQL injection, XSS)

### Performance Success
- Authentication flow completes in <5 seconds
- System handles 100 concurrent authentication requests
- 99.9% uptime for authentication services
- Zero security incidents during MVP period

### Adoption Success
- Integration time <2 hours for new applications
- Developer satisfaction score >4.5/5
- <5% support tickets related to authentication issues
- 90% of integrated applications actively using the service after 30 days

## Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope
- Email/password based registration and login
- Secure session token generation and validation
- Password strength requirements and hashing
- Email verification for new accounts
- Password reset via email
- Basic user profile data management
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- HTTPS enforcement and security headers

### Out of Scope
- Social login integration (future epic)
- Multi-factor authentication (future epic)
- Advanced user attributes beyond basic profile
- Role-based access control (future epic)
- User activity auditing (future epic)
- Custom password policies (MVP uses standard policies)

## Key Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions
- Developers will integrate using standard web technologies (HTTP/HTTPS, JSON)
- Email delivery service will be reliable for verification and reset flows
- Target applications will implement proper HTTPS and security practices

### Business Assumptions
- Small-scale developers value simplicity over extensive customization
- Zero-cost operation is possible using free tiers of existing services
- Basic authentication features will satisfy 80% of initial use cases

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Email service provider for verification and password reset
- Database solution for secure user data storage
- SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication
- Hosting platform with appropriate security capabilities

### Business Dependencies
- Clear documentation and developer onboarding materials
- Support channels for developer questions and issues
- Marketing and communication strategy for developer adoption

## Risks & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
- **Security Implementation**: Risk of vulnerabilities in custom authentication code
  - *Mitigation*: Use established authentication libraries and frameworks
- **Scalability**: Risk of service degradation under load
  - *Mitigation*: Performance testing and monitoring from day one
- **Data Protection**: Risk of user data exposure or loss
  - *Mitigation*: Encryption at rest and in transit, regular security audits

### Medium-Risk Areas
- **Email Deliverability**: Risk of verification/reset emails not reaching users
  - *Mitigation*: Multiple email provider options and delivery monitoring
- **User Experience**: Risk of complex authentication flows deterring adoption
  - *Mitigation*: User testing and iterative UX improvements

## Definition of Done

### Technical Completion
- All authentication endpoints implemented and tested
- Security measures verified through penetration testing
- Performance benchmarks met under expected load
- Integration documentation complete and validated

### User Acceptance
- Beta developers successfully integrate within 2-hour target
- User flows tested and validated with real users
- Security review completed by external party
- Monitoring and alerting systems operational
