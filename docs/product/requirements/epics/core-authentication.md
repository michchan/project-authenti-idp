# Epic: Core Authentication System

## Problem Statement

Solo developers building multiple small applications need a cost-effective, secure authentication system that integrates quickly without requiring security expertise. Building authentication from scratch is time-consuming, error-prone, and diverts focus from core product features, while existing solutions are often too expensive or complex for personal projects.

## Business Value

### Primary Value
- **Time Savings**: Eliminates 30-40% of typical application development time spent on authentication
- **Zero-Cost Operation**: Operates entirely within free-tier constraints (<$50/month for <100 users)
- **Rapid Integration**: 2-hour integration time from start to working authentication

### Secondary Value
- **Faster Time-to-Market**: Applications can launch sooner without authentication implementation delays
- **Reduced Risk**: Minimizes security vulnerabilities from custom authentication implementations
- **Developer Experience**: Consistent authentication patterns across multiple applications

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- Solo developers building multiple small applications
- Small teams (2-5 people) managing application portfolios
- Product managers seeking to optimize development resources

### User Needs
- Secure user registration and login functionality within budget constraints
- Basic OAuth/OIDC compliance for modern web applications
- Simple integration with minimal configuration and dependencies
- Reliable session management across multiple personal projects

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success
- Users can register new accounts with email verification
- OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE implemented
- OpenID Connect ID token generation and validation
- Password reset functionality via secure email flow
- Basic user profile management (name, email, avatar)
- Rate limiting and basic security headers implemented

### Performance Success
- Authentication flow completes in <5 seconds
- System handles 50 concurrent authentication requests (MVP constraint)
- 99% uptime target using free-tier infrastructure
- Operational costs remain under $50/month for first 100 users

### Adoption Success
- Integration time <2 hours for new applications
- Developer satisfaction score >4.5/5
- <5% support tickets related to authentication issues
- 90% of integrated applications actively using the service after 30 days

## Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope
- Email/password based registration and login
- OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE
- OpenID Connect ID token generation
- JWT access token and refresh token management
- Email verification for new accounts
- Password reset via email
- Basic user profile data management (name, email, avatar)
- Rate limiting using free-tier solutions
- HTTPS enforcement and basic security headers

### Out of Scope (Post-MVP)
- Social login integration (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Advanced user attributes and custom fields
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- User activity auditing and analytics
- Custom password policies and advanced security features
- Enterprise SSO protocols (SAML)
- Advanced threat detection and prevention

## Key Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions
- Developers will integrate using standard web technologies (HTTP/HTTPS, JSON)
- Email delivery service will be reliable for verification and reset flows
- Target applications will implement proper HTTPS and security practices

### Business Assumptions
- Solo developers prioritize cost-effectiveness and integration speed
- Free-tier infrastructure can support MVP requirements (<100 users)
- Basic OAuth/OIDC implementation satisfies personal project needs
- 2-hour integration target is achievable with simplified scope

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Email service provider with free tier (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun free plans)
- Database solution with free tier (e.g., Supabase, PlanetScale free plans)
- SSL/TLS certificates (free via Let's Encrypt or platform-provided)
- Hosting platform with OAuth compliance (e.g., Vercel, Netlify free tiers)

### Business Dependencies
- Clear documentation and developer onboarding materials
- Support channels for developer questions and issues
- Marketing and communication strategy for developer adoption

## Risks & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
- **Cost Overrun**: Risk of exceeding $50/month operational budget
  - *Mitigation*: Strict monitoring of service usage and automatic scaling limits
- **Free Tier Limitations**: Risk of hitting service limits unexpectedly
  - *Mitigation*: Usage monitoring and graceful degradation strategies
- **Security vs. Cost Balance**: Risk of compromising security for cost savings
  - *Mitigation*: Focus on standard OAuth/OIDC implementation with proven libraries

### Medium-Risk Areas
- **Email Deliverability**: Risk of verification/reset emails not reaching users
  - *Mitigation*: Multiple email provider options and delivery monitoring
- **User Experience**: Risk of complex authentication flows deterring adoption
  - *Mitigation*: User testing and iterative UX improvements

## Definition of Done

### Technical Completion
- All authentication endpoints implemented and tested
- Security measures verified through penetration testing
- Performance benchmarks met under expected load
- Integration documentation complete and validated

### User Acceptance
- Beta developers successfully integrate within 2-hour target
- User flows tested and validated with real users
- Security review completed by external party
- Monitoring and alerting systems operational
