# Epic: Sample Application & Demo Platform

## Problem Statement

Developers need to see the IDP service in action before committing to integration. Without a working example, it's difficult to understand the user experience, evaluate the integration effort, and validate that the solution meets their needs.

## Business Value

### Primary Value
- **Conversion Catalyst**: Demonstrates value proposition clearly to prospective users
- **Onboarding Acceleration**: Provides working reference for integration patterns
- **Trust Building**: Shows production-quality implementation and user experience

### Secondary Value
- **Marketing Asset**: Compelling demo for showcasing capabilities
- **Development Reference**: Living documentation of best practices
- **Testing Platform**: Real-world validation of IDP functionality

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- Prospective developers evaluating the IDP service
- Existing users seeking integration examples
- Product managers assessing solution fit

### User Needs
- Clear demonstration of authentication flow and user experience
- Working code examples showing integration patterns
- Ability to test functionality without committing to integration
- Evidence that solution works reliably in practice

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success
- Complete authentication flow from login to application access
- Multiple applications demonstrating cross-product single sign-on
- User registration, login, logout, and profile management working
- Integration code available and documented for reference

### Experience Success
- Authentication flow completes smoothly without errors
- User interface is professional and trustworthy
- Cross-application navigation demonstrates seamless experience
- Code examples are clear and well-documented

### Business Success
- Demo referenced in 90% of integration documentation usage
- <5% of demo sessions encounter technical issues
- Sample applications effectively demonstrate IDP value for personal projects

## Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope
- Primary sample application with full IDP integration
- Secondary sample application demonstrating cross-product SSO
- User flows: registration, login, logout, profile editing
- Developer-focused code examples and documentation
- Responsive web design for desktop and mobile viewing
- Basic application functionality to contextualize authentication

### Out of Scope
- Complex application logic beyond authentication demonstration
- Mobile applications (web-based demo only for MVP)
- Advanced features not available in MVP (social login, MFA)
- Production-scale application performance optimization
- Custom branding or white-label capabilities

## Key Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions
- Web-based demo will adequately represent integration patterns
- Simple application functionality will effectively demonstrate authentication value
- Developers will extrapolate demo patterns to their own applications

### Business Assumptions
- Working demo will significantly increase conversion rates
- Code examples will reduce integration support burden
- Demo applications will remain technically current with IDP service

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Core authentication system (see [core-authentication.md](core-authentication.md))
- Application integration platform (see [application-integration.md](application-integration.md))
- Web hosting platform for demo applications
- SSL certificates for secure demonstration

### Business Dependencies
- Marketing strategy for promoting demo availability
- Documentation platform for code examples
- Feedback collection mechanism for demo improvements

## User Journey

### Discovery and Demo
1. Developer discovers IDP service through marketing or referral
2. Accesses demo applications through landing page
3. Tests registration and login flows as end user
4. Navigates between applications to experience SSO
5. Reviews code examples and integration documentation

### Evaluation and Decision
1. Compares demo experience to current authentication solutions
2. Evaluates integration complexity through code examples
3. Assesses fit for their specific use case and requirements
4. Makes decision to proceed with integration or explore alternatives

## Demo Applications

### Primary Application: "TaskFlow" - Simple Project Management
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate core authentication and user management
- **Features**: User registration, login, basic project creation, profile editing
- **Integration**: Full OAuth 2.0 flow with token management

### Secondary Application: "TimeTracker" - Simple Time Logging
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate cross-application SSO experience where users can seamlessly move between applications
- **Features**: Time entry with project selection, basic time reporting, shared user profile data from TaskFlow
- **Integration**: Utilizes same user session as TaskFlow, demonstrating how users can navigate between applications without re-authentication
- **SSO Demo**: Shows how project data from TaskFlow can inform time tracking options, creating a cohesive multi-application experience

## Definition of Done

### Technical Completion
- Both demo applications deployed and accessible
- All authentication flows working without errors
- Code repositories available with documentation
- Integration examples covering common scenarios
- Performance acceptable for demo purposes

### User Acceptance
- User testing validates smooth authentication experience
- Code examples effectively demonstrate integration patterns
- Demo showcases personal project development workflows
- All major browsers and devices supported for demo access
