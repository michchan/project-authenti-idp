# Epic: Sample Application & Journey-Based Demo Experience

## Problem Statement

Solo developers need to quickly evaluate if the IDP service fits their personal project workflow and budget constraints. Without a contextual demo that shows the complete developer journey from discovery to implementation, it's difficult to assess the true integration effort and ongoing cost implications.

## Business Value

### Primary Value
- **Journey Validation**: Demonstrates complete developer workflow from idea to live application
- **Cost Transparency**: Shows real resource usage and operational costs
- **Integration Confidence**: Proves 2-hour integration target is achievable

### Secondary Value
- **Marketing Asset**: Compelling demo for showcasing capabilities
- **Development Reference**: Living documentation of best practices
- **Testing Platform**: Real-world validation of IDP functionality

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- Solo developers evaluating authentication options for personal projects
- Independent developers building application portfolios
- Small teams assessing cost-effective authentication solutions

### User Needs
- Complete developer journey from project idea to live authentication
- Real-world cost and resource consumption transparency
- Working examples that match their typical project constraints
- Proof that personal projects can scale without surprise costs

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success
- End-to-end developer journey from idea to deployed application
- Real-time cost and usage monitoring visible throughout demo
- Multiple applications showing portfolio-style authentication
- Integration achieved within 2-hour target time

### Experience Success
- Developer journey feels realistic and achievable
- Cost transparency builds confidence in long-term sustainability
- Cross-application SSO demonstrates portfolio value
- Integration process matches documentation exactly

### Business Success
- 90% of developers complete full demo journey in single session
- Demo directly leads to 70% of successful integrations
- Cost transparency increases confidence in service adoption

## Scope & Boundaries

### In Scope
- Journey-based demo experience from idea to deployment
- Two realistic personal project applications with full integration
- Real-time cost and usage monitoring throughout demo
- Step-by-step developer workflow with actual time tracking
- Mobile-optimized experience for developers on-the-go
- Contextual help and documentation integrated within demo journey

### Out of Scope (Post-MVP)
- Complex application logic beyond authentication context
- Native mobile application demos
- Advanced features not in MVP scope
- Production-scale performance optimization demos
- Custom branding or enterprise features

## Key Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions
- Journey-based approach will better represent real developer workflow
- Cost transparency will differentiate demo from competitor offerings
- Personal project context will resonate with target developer persona

### Business Assumptions
- Journey-based demo will increase conversion over traditional demos
- Cost transparency will reduce pre-sales questions and objections
- Realistic project examples will reduce post-integration support needs

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Core authentication system (see [core-authentication.md](core-authentication.md))
- Application integration platform (see [application-integration.md](application-integration.md))
- Web hosting platform for demo applications
- SSL certificates for secure demonstration

### Business Dependencies
- Marketing strategy for promoting demo availability
- Documentation platform for code examples
- Feedback collection mechanism for demo improvements

## Developer Journey Experience

### Complete Journey Demo (30-45 minutes)
1. **Project Ideation**: Developer starts with "I want to build..." scenario
2. **Service Discovery**: Guided introduction to IDP as authentication solution
3. **Quick Registration**: Registers for developer account in under 2 minutes
4. **Live Integration**: Follows along as demo implements authentication in real-time
5. **Testing Experience**: Tests authentication flow as end user
6. **Portfolio Expansion**: Sees how second application integrates with SSO
7. **Cost Reality Check**: Reviews actual resource usage and projected costs
8. **Deployment Workflow**: Watches complete deployment to production

### Decision Making Phase
1. Compares time investment vs. alternative solutions
2. Evaluates cost trajectory for their project portfolio
3. Assesses technical fit with their development preferences
4. Makes informed decision with complete context

## Journey-Based Demo Applications

### Primary Application: "DevPortfolio" - Personal Developer Portfolio
- **Journey Context**: "I want to showcase my projects with user authentication"
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates authentication for content management and visitor interaction
- **Features**: Project showcase, visitor comments, contact form, admin panel
- **Cost Focus**: Shows resource usage for typical personal portfolio traffic

### Secondary Application: "ProjectTracker" - Simple Project Management
- **Journey Context**: "I want to expand my portfolio with a useful tool"
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates SSO between applications and data sharing
- **Features**: Task management, project timeline, shared user profiles from DevPortfolio
- **Cost Focus**: Shows incremental costs of adding applications to portfolio
- **SSO Demo**: Seamless navigation between portfolio and project tools

## Definition of Done
