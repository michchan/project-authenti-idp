         |                           |                        |
         v                           ↑                        |
[Account activated] ←──────────────┘ ←──────────────────┘
         |
         v
[Authentication successful]
         |
         v
[Redirect back to original application]
         |
         v
[User lands in application as authenticated]
         |
         v
[Registration complete - user ready for SSO across apps]
```

### Key Screens/States

**Registration Page**: Clean form with clear password requirements, email validation, and help text for complex rules

**Email Verification Page**: Clear messaging about checking email with option to resend verification

**Login Page**: Simple login form with "Remember me" option and clear error messaging

**Success State**: Smooth redirect back to original application with user authenticated

### Pain Points & Optimizations

**Current Friction**: Password complexity requirements may cause abandonment

**Optimization Ideas**: 
- Progressive password validation with real-time feedback
- Social login options in future versions
- Clear progress indicators during email verification wait


### Error Handling

**Validation Errors**: Real-time validation with specific, actionable error messages

**System Errors**: Graceful degradation with retry options and clear next steps

**Recovery Paths**: Easy access to password reset, email resend, and support contact

---

## 2. End User SSO Login Flow

### Flow Purpose
**Goal**: Provide seamless authentication experience for returning users across multiple connected applications

**Success Criteria**: Authenticated user can access any connected application without re-entering credentials

### ASCII Flow Diagram

```
[User visits Application A (already has session)]
         |
         v
[Application checks for valid token]
         |
         v
<Token valid?> ──→ [YES] ──→ [User accesses app directly]
         |                        |
         v                        v
[NO - Redirect to AuthentiIDP]  [Session continues]
         |
         v
[AuthentiIDP checks for active session]
         |
         v
<Active session exists?> ──→ [YES] ──→ [Redirect to App A]
         |                              |
         v                              v
[NO - Show login form]               [User accesses App A]
         |
         v
[User enters credentials]
         |
         v
[Authentication successful]
         |
         v
[User now has SSO session (valid for 30-90 days) for all apps]
         |
         v
[User visits Application B]
         |
         v
[App B redirects to AuthentiIDP]
         |
         v
[Redirect to App B - NO LOGIN REQUIRED]
         |
         v
[Seamless SSO experience across applications]
```

### Key Screens/States

**Invisible Success**: Most SSO flows should be invisible - user never sees login page

**Login Page (fallback)**: Only appears when session expired or first visit

**Loading States**: Brief loading indicators during token exchange and validation

**Application Landing**: User lands directly in application with full authentication

### Pain Points & Optimizations

**Current Friction**: Token expiration causing unexpected login prompts

**Optimization Ideas**:
- Automatic token refresh before expiration
- Background session validation
- Graceful handling of network timeouts


### Error Handling

**Token Expiration**: Smooth re-authentication flow without losing context

**Network Issues**: Retry mechanisms with fallback to cached authentication

**Application Errors**: Clear error messages with paths back to working state

**Optimization Ideas**:
- SMS backup option for password reset
- In-app notifications when possible
- Clear email sender identification
- Multiple retry attempts with escalating help


### Error Handling

**Email Delivery Issues**: Alternative contact methods and manual support options

**Token Expiration**: Clear error messaging with easy restart of reset process

**Validation Errors**: Real-time feedback with specific improvement suggestions
