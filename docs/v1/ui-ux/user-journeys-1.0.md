## 1. End User Registration & First Login

### Flow Purpose
**Goal**: Enable new users to create an account and successfully authenticate for the first time across multiple applications

**Success Criteria**: User completes registration, verifies email, and successfully logs into at least one connected application within 10 minutes

### ASCII Flow Diagram

- Social login options in future versions
- Clear progress indicators during email verification wait


### Error Handling

**Validation Errors**: Real-time validation with specific, actionable error messages

**System Errors**: Graceful degradation with retry options and clear next steps

**Recovery Paths**: Easy access to password reset, email resend, and support contact

---

## 2. End User SSO Login Flow

### Flow Purpose
**Goal**: Provide seamless authentication experience for returning users across multiple connected applications

**Success Criteria**: Authenticated user can access any connected application without re-entering credentials

### ASCII Flow Diagram

```
[User visits Application A (already has session)]
         |
         v
[Application checks for valid token]
         |
         v
[Token valid?] ──→ [YES] ──→ [User accesses app directly]
         |                        |
         v                        v
[NO - Redirect to AuthentiIDP]  [Session continues]
         |
         v
[AuthentiIDP checks for active session]
         |
         v
[Active session exists?] ──→ [YES] ──→ [Generate new token for App A]
         |                              |
         v                              v
[NO - Show login form]               [Redirect back to App A with token]
         |                              |
         v                              v
[User enters credentials]            [App A validates token with IDP]
         |                              |
         v                              v
[Authentication successful]          [User accesses App A]
         |
         v
[Create session in IDP]
         |
         v
[Generate token for App A]
         |
         v
[Redirect to App A with token]
         |
         v
[User now has SSO session for all apps]
         |
         v
[User visits Application B]
         |
         v
[App B redirects to AuthentiIDP]
         |
         v
[IDP detects existing session]
         |
         v
[Generates token for App B immediately]
         |
         v
[Redirect to App B - NO LOGIN REQUIRED]
         |
         v
[Seamless SSO experience across applications]
```

### Key Screens/States

**Invisible Success**: Most SSO flows should be invisible - user never sees login page

**Login Page (fallback)**: Only appears when session expired or first visit

**Loading States**: Brief loading indicators during token exchange and validation

**Application Landing**: User lands directly in application with full authentication

### Pain Points & Optimizations

**Current Friction**: Token expiration causing unexpected login prompts

**Optimization Ideas**:
- Automatic token refresh before expiration
- Background session validation
- Graceful handling of network timeouts


### Error Handling

**Token Expiration**: Smooth re-authentication flow without losing context

**Network Issues**: Retry mechanisms with fallback to cached authentication

**Application Errors**: Clear error messages with paths back to working state

### Key Screens/States

**Logout Options**: Clear choice between local and global logout with explanations

**Confirmation Page**: Summary of logout actions with option to re-login

**Session Status**: Visual indication of active sessions across applications

**Timeout Warning**: Advance notice before session expiration with extend option

### Pain Points & Optimizations

**Current Friction**: Users confused about partial vs complete logout

**Optimization Ideas**:
- Visual session status indicators
- "Remember this choice" for logout preference
- Gradual logout warnings before forced logout
- Quick re-authentication for recent logouts


### Error Handling

**Logout Failures**: Retry mechanisms with manual session clearing

**Network Issues**: Offline logout capability with sync when reconnected

**Partial Logout**: Clear status of which applications are still authenticated

## 🔗 Inter-Flow Connections

Show how different user journeys connect:

| From Flow | Leads To | Trigger/Context |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Registration | SSO Login | User completes email verification |
| SSO Login | Profile Management | User clicks profile/settings link |
| Profile Management | Password Reset | User chooses to change password |
| Password Reset | SSO Login | User completes password change |
| Developer Integration | Application Management | Developer needs to configure app |
| Application Management | User Analytics | Manager wants to see user metrics |
| Session Management | SSO Login | User logs out then returns |
| Any Flow | Error Recovery | System errors or user mistakes |

**Connection Notes**: All flows are designed to maintain user context and provide clear paths between related functionality. Error states always include recovery paths back to successful workflows.

## 📱 Multi-Device Considerations

### Mobile-Responsive Design
- Touch-friendly interfaces with adequate tap targets (44px minimum)
- Simplified navigation suitable for small screens
- Progressive disclosure of complex information
- Optimized forms for mobile keyboards

### Cross-Device Session Continuity
- Sessions work consistently across desktop, tablet, and mobile
- QR code options for easy device-to-device authentication transfer
- Mobile-first design with desktop enhancements
- Consistent visual design language across all device types

### Performance Optimization
- Fast loading on mobile networks (< 3 seconds on 3G)
- Minimal data usage for authentication flows
- Offline capability for critical authentication status
- Progressive web app features for improved mobile experience

---

## 🎯 User Experience Principles

### Simplicity First
- Authentication flows should be invisible when possible
- Clear, action-oriented language in all interfaces
- Minimal cognitive load - users focused on their actual goals
- Progressive disclosure of advanced features

### Trust and Security
- Transparent communication about data handling
- Visual security indicators (HTTPS, secure badges)
- Clear privacy controls and data export options
- No dark patterns or misleading interface elements

### Developer Experience
- SDK abstracts complexity while providing flexibility
- Comprehensive documentation with working code examples
- Clear error messages with actionable next steps
- Testing and debugging tools built into the SDK

### Performance and Reliability
- Fast authentication flows (< 2 seconds typical)
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Automatic retry and recovery mechanisms
- Clear status communication during loading states
