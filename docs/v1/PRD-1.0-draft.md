# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview
- **Product Name**: AuthentiIDP - Centralized Identity Provider Service
- **Author**: Product Manager
- **Date**: 2025-08-10
- **Status**: In Review
- **Version**: 1.0

### âœ… Approvals Checklist
- [x] System Architect
- [x] Product Owner
- [ ] Business Owner

## 2. Objective
AuthentiIDP is a centralized identity provider service similar to Facebook/Google SSO that enables users to register and login once across multiple applications. The service provides secure, scalable authentication with minimal cost, smooth UX/DX, and includes an SDK for easy integration with client applications.

## 3. Problem Statement
Building authentication and user management systems for each individual application creates significant redundancy, development overhead, and maintenance complexity. Users face the inconvenience of managing multiple accounts across different applications, while developers spend valuable time implementing authentication instead of core business features. Small-scale applications need a cost-effective identity solution that doesn't compromise on security or user experience while being easily extendable for future growth.

Current solutions either:
- Require significant infrastructure investment and maintenance overhead
- Are overengineered for small-scale applications (less than 50 users)
- Lack proper SDK support for seamless integration
- Have high operational costs that don't align with small application budgets

## 4. Goals & Non-goals

### Goals
- Enable single sign-on (SSO) capability for multiple personal applications
- Provide secure user registration, authentication, and profile management
- Deliver easy-to-integrate SDK with clear documentation and examples
- Minimize operational costs with zero-cost MVP approach using free tiers
- Create smooth user experience with modern authentication flows
- Build extensible architecture that can scale beyond initial 50-user constraint
- Include comprehensive sample web application for testing and demonstration
- Ensure minimal application design without feature redundancy
- Provide excellent developer experience with clear onboarding processes

### Non-goals
- Enterprise-grade features like SAML, LDAP integration, or complex role hierarchies in v1.0
- Multi-tenant architecture with organization management in v1.0
- Advanced user analytics and behavioral tracking in v1.0
- Third-party identity provider integrations (Facebook, Google SSO) in v1.0
- Complex user permission systems beyond basic role assignments in v1.0
- High-availability infrastructure setup for MVP (can accept some downtime)
- White-label customization options for different applications in v1.0

  - Users remain authenticated across applications during active session
  - Single logout functionality that terminates sessions across all applications
  - Session synchronization between IDP and client applications
  - Automatic token refresh for extended sessions
  - Cross-domain session management with secure cookies
- **Notes**: Implement with JWT tokens and refresh token rotation for security

### Feature 3: Developer SDK & Integration Tools
- **User Story**: As a developer, I want easy-to-use SDK with clear documentation so that I can integrate authentication in under 4-6 hours.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - React frontend SDK with comprehensive API coverage for client-side integration
  - NodeJS backend SDK for server-side authentication and API protection
  - SDK handles token management, refresh, and storage automatically
  - Pre-built UI components for login/register forms (React)
  - Integration examples for React frontend and NodeJS backend
  - Comprehensive documentation with code examples for both SDKs
  - Error handling and debugging tools included in both SDKs
- **Notes**: Focus on React frontend and NodeJS backend SDKs for MVP. Multi-framework support deprioritized for initial release.

### Feature 4: User Profile Management
- **User Story**: As an end user, I want to manage my profile information centrally so that updates are reflected across all connected applications.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Users can view and update basic profile information (name, email, avatar)
  - Profile changes propagate to connected applications
  - Account deletion functionality with data export option
  - Privacy settings for controlling data sharing with applications
  - Audit log of profile changes and application access
- **Notes**: GDPR compliance considerations for data export and deletion

### Feature 5: Application Management Dashboard
- **User Story**: As a product manager, I want to manage connected applications and view basic statistics so that I can monitor usage and make informed decisions.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Dashboard showing registered applications and their status
  - Basic user registration and authentication counts per application
  - Application-specific configuration (redirect URLs, permissions)
  - API keys and secret management for applications
  - Simple usage metrics (login counts, active users)
- **Notes**: Core authentication features prioritized over advanced analytics for MVP
