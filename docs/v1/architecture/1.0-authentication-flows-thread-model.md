# Threat Model — AuthentiIDP Core Authentication Flows

## Overview
- **Flow Name:** AuthentiIDP Core Authentication and Identity Management
- **Prepared By:** Security Expert
- **Reviewed By:** System Architect (Pending)
- **Architecture Reference:** /docs/v1/architecture/system-architecture-1.0.md (TBD)
- **Version:** 1.0

## 1. Flow Description
This threat model covers the critical security flows for AuthentiIDP, a centralized identity provider service that enables single sign-on across multiple personal applications. The scope includes:

- **User Registration & Email Verification**: New user account creation with email-based verification
- **User Authentication & Session Management**: Login flows with JWT token management and 30-day refresh tokens
- **Single Sign-On (SSO) Flows**: Cross-application authentication without re-login
- **Password Reset & Recovery**: Account recovery mechanisms via email
- **Profile Management**: Centralized user profile updates propagated across applications
- **SDK Integration**: Client application authentication via React/NodeJS SDKs

**Key Security Boundaries:**
- AuthentiIDP service (identity provider)
- Client applications (using SDKs)
- Email service (verification/reset)
- User browser/session storage
- Database (user credentials and profile data)

**Critical Assets:**
- User credentials (passwords, hashed)
- JWT access/refresh tokens
- Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
- API keys and client secrets
- Session data and authentication state

- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses that don't leak internals

## 7. Compliance and Privacy Considerations

### GDPR Compliance
- **Right to Access**: User profile export functionality
- **Right to Deletion**: Secure account deletion with data purging
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary user information
- **Consent Management**: Granular privacy controls for data sharing

### Security Standards
- **OWASP Top 10**: Address all current OWASP vulnerabilities
- **OAuth 2.0/OIDC**: Full compliance with industry authentication standards
- **NIST Guidelines**: Follow NIST 800-63B for authentication requirements

## 8. Monitoring and Detection

### Security Metrics to Track
- Failed login attempts per user/IP
- Unusual login patterns (time, location, device)
- JWT token abuse patterns
- API rate limit violations
- Profile data access patterns
- Password reset frequency anomalies

### Alerting Thresholds
- Multiple failed logins (5+ attempts in 5 minutes)
- Login from new device/location
- High API error rates (>5% error rate)
- Unusual profile data modifications
- Mass password reset attempts

## 9. Residual Risks

**Accepted Risks with Mitigation Strategy:**
- **Email Provider Vulnerabilities**: Risk accepted as email verification is industry standard; mitigation through multiple email providers and security monitoring
- **Social Engineering Attacks**: Technical controls cannot prevent all social engineering; user education and support team training required
- **Third-party Dependencies**: Risk of vulnerabilities in SDK dependencies; mitigation through automated dependency scanning and rapid patching
- **Client Application Security**: Cannot control security of client applications using the SDK; mitigation through security guidelines and best practices documentation
- **DNS Attacks**: Risk of DNS hijacking affecting authentication flows; mitigation through DNS security extensions (DNSSEC) and monitoring

**Monitoring Required:**
- Regular security advisory monitoring for all dependencies
- Continuous vulnerability assessment of the entire authentication stack
- User behavior pattern analysis for anomaly detection
- Client application security posture assessment

**Review Notes for System Architect:**
This threat model should inform the system architecture design, particularly around:
1. Service communication patterns and security boundaries
2. Data flow diagrams with trust boundaries clearly marked
3. Infrastructure security controls and network segmentation
4. SDK architecture with built-in security controls
5. Database design with encryption and access controls

**Next Steps:**
1. System Architect review and validation of security requirements
2. Integration of security controls into system design documents
3. Development of security test cases for each identified threat
4. Creation of incident response procedures for high-risk scenarios
