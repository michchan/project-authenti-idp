# üìà User Journey Guidelines

Comprehensive guidance for creating effective user journey documentation using the user journeys template.

---

## üéØ Purpose & When to Use

**Purpose**: Document user flows using ASCII diagrams to visualize how users navigate through your product, identifying pain points and optimization opportunities.

**When to use**:
- Designing new features or major workflow changes
- Optimizing existing user flows for better conversion
- Onboarding team members to understand user paths
- Identifying friction points in current user experience
- Planning cross-team coordination for complex flows

---

## üß≠ Journey Planning & Research

### Before Creating Flows
- **Research actual user behavior**: Use analytics, user interviews, support tickets
- **Define clear user goals**: What is the user trying to accomplish?
- **Identify user personas**: Different user types may have different paths
- **Gather baseline metrics**: Current conversion rates, drop-off points, task completion times

### Journey Scope Definition
- **Focus on specific goals**: One complete user objective per journey
- **Include entry and exit points**: How users start and end the flow
- **Consider alternative paths**: Not all users follow the happy path
- **Account for error scenarios**: What happens when things go wrong?

---

## üìä ASCII Flow Creation

### Diagram Structure
- **Start with the happy path**: Document the ideal user journey first
- **Add branching points**: Show where users can take different paths
- **Include decision points**: Where users make choices that affect the flow
- **Show system states**: Loading, processing, confirmation states

### Symbol Usage Best Practices
- **Consistent formatting**: Use the same symbols throughout all flows
- **Clear labeling**: Every step should be clearly labeled and understandable
- **Logical flow direction**: Use arrows to show progression through the journey
- **Group related steps**: Use visual grouping to show related actions

### Visual Clarity
- **Keep diagrams readable**: Don't try to fit too much in one diagram
- **Use whitespace effectively**: Make diagrams easy to scan and understand
- **Test in monospace**: Ensure ASCII art displays correctly
- **Break complex flows**: Split very long journeys into multiple connected diagrams

---

## üîç Flow Documentation Standards

### Step-by-Step Details
- **Screen/state descriptions**: What the user sees at each step
- **User actions required**: What the user needs to do to progress
- **System responses**: How the system reacts to user actions
- **Time estimates**: Realistic time expectations for each step

### Context Information
- **Prerequisites**: What conditions must be met before starting this flow
- **User permissions**: What access level is required
- **Device considerations**: How the flow differs on mobile vs. desktop
- **Browser requirements**: Any specific browser features needed

---

## üö® Pain Points & Optimization

### Identifying Friction
- **Drop-off points**: Where do users most commonly exit the flow?
- **Confusion points**: Steps that users find unclear or difficult
- **Time sinks**: Steps that take longer than necessary
- **Error-prone areas**: Where users frequently make mistakes

### Documentation Strategies
- **Quantify problems**: Use data to show the impact of friction points
- **User quotes**: Include actual user feedback about pain points
- **Competitor analysis**: How do other products handle similar flows?
- **Prioritization framework**: Which issues to tackle first

### Optimization Ideas
- **Specific improvements**: Concrete suggestions for reducing friction
- **A/B test opportunities**: Areas suitable for testing different approaches
- **Quick wins**: Low-effort changes with potentially high impact
- **Long-term improvements**: Larger changes that require more planning

## üîß Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Error Scenarios
- **Validation errors**: Form field errors, invalid inputs, missing information
- **System errors**: Network issues, server problems, timeout errors
- **User errors**: Wrong information, accidental actions, confusion
- **External errors**: Third-party service failures, payment processing issues

### Recovery Paths
- **Clear error messages**: What went wrong and how to fix it
- **Alternative options**: Other ways to complete the goal
- **Escalation paths**: When to involve support or manual processes
- **Prevention strategies**: How to reduce the likelihood of errors

### Edge Case Considerations
- **First-time users**: How is the flow different for new users?
- **Power users**: Shortcuts or advanced options for experienced users?
- **Accessibility needs**: How does the flow work for users with disabilities?
- **Low-bandwidth scenarios**: How does the flow perform on slow connections?

---

## üîó Inter-Flow Connections

### Flow Relationships
- **Sequential flows**: One flow naturally leads to another
- **Parallel flows**: Multiple flows that can happen simultaneously
- **Conditional flows**: Flows that branch based on user characteristics or choices
- **Return flows**: How users get back to previous states

### Connection Documentation
- **Trigger conditions**: What causes users to move between flows
- **Context preservation**: What information carries over between flows
- **Navigation patterns**: How users move between different areas of the product
- **State management**: How system state changes affect available flows

---

## üì± Multi-Device Considerations

### Device-Specific Behavior
- **Mobile adaptations**: How flows change on smaller screens
- **Desktop enhancements**: Additional functionality available on larger screens
- **Tablet considerations**: Hybrid behaviors for medium-sized screens
- **Cross-device continuity**: Starting on one device, finishing on another

### Input Method Differences
- **Touch vs. mouse**: Different interaction patterns and capabilities
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for all flows
- **Voice control**: How flows work with voice assistants or dictation
- **Gesture support**: Swipe, pinch, and other touch gestures

---

## üìä Metrics & Measurement

### Success Metrics
- **Conversion rates**: Percentage of users who complete the flow
- **Time to completion**: How long the flow takes for successful users
- **Error rates**: Frequency of errors at each step
- **Abandonment points**: Where users most commonly exit the flow

### Measurement Strategy
- **Event tracking**: Specific user actions to track in analytics
- **Funnel analysis**: Step-by-step conversion through the flow
- **Cohort analysis**: How flow performance changes over time
- **A/B testing**: Controlled experiments to improve flow performance

### Review Cadence
- **Regular monitoring**: How often to check flow performance
- **Threshold alerts**: When performance drops below acceptable levels
- **Quarterly reviews**: Deeper analysis of flow effectiveness
- **Annual audits**: Comprehensive review and optimization planning

---

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Usability Testing
- **Task-based testing**: Can users complete the flow successfully?
- **Think-aloud protocols**: What are users thinking at each step?
- **Time-to-task completion**: How long does the flow actually take?
- **Error recovery testing**: How do users handle mistakes?

### Analytics Validation
- **Compare to documentation**: Does actual user behavior match documented flows?
- **Identify deviations**: Where do users take unexpected paths?
- **Measure impact**: Did flow changes improve the intended metrics?
- **Continuous monitoring**: Ongoing validation of flow effectiveness

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Documentation Issues
- **Happy path only**: Not documenting error cases and alternative paths
- **Generic scenarios**: Using theoretical users instead of real personas
- **Stale documentation**: Flows don't match current product implementation
- **Missing context**: Not explaining why users would take certain paths

### Research Issues
- **Assumption-based flows**: Creating flows without user research validation
- **Missing edge cases**: Not considering users with different needs or contexts
- **Ignoring analytics**: Not using data to inform flow documentation
- **Single device focus**: Only considering desktop or mobile, not both

### Process Issues
- **No stakeholder review**: Flows created in isolation without team input
- **Poor maintenance**: Flows become outdated as product changes
- **Inconsistent format**: Different team members use different documentation styles
- **Missing metrics**: No way to measure if documented flows are actually effective
