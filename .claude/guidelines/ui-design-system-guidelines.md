## üé® Color Palette Guidelines

### Color Organization
- **Group by function**: Primary, secondary, background, text, status colors
- **Use descriptive names**: "Primary Blue" not "Blue #1"
- **Include accessibility information**: Note contrast ratios and WCAG compliance
- **Show usage context**: When and where to use each color

### Visual Representation
- **Create actual color swatches**: Don't just list hex codes
- **Use realistic sizing**: Show colors at sizes they'll actually be used
- **Include hover/active states**: Show how colors change during interactions
- **Demonstrate combinations**: Show colors working together in realistic layouts

### Technical Implementation
- **Provide CSS custom properties**: `--color-primary: #2563EB;`
- **Include multiple formats**: Hex, RGB, HSL as needed
- **Show usage examples**: How to implement colors in code
- **Document color tokens**: Naming conventions for design systems

### Best Practices
- **Limit your palette**: Too many colors create inconsistency
- **Consider accessibility**: Ensure sufficient contrast ratios
- **Plan for dark mode**: How do colors adapt for different themes?
- **Test in context**: Colors look different against various backgrounds

## üî§ Typography Guidelines

### Font System Setup
- **Define font hierarchy**: H1-H6, body text, captions, labels
- **Specify font families**: Primary for content, secondary for UI elements
- **Include fallbacks**: Web-safe fonts for when custom fonts don't load
- **Show font weights**: When to use regular, medium, bold, etc.

### Visual Examples
- **Create live previews**: Show actual rendered text at each hierarchy level
- **Use real content**: Product-specific text, not "Lorem ipsum"
- **Show length variations**: How do short vs. long titles look?
- **Include interactive states**: How does text look when hovered or focused?

### Technical Specifications
- **Provide exact sizes**: Font-size in px/rem, line-height ratios
- **Include spacing**: Margins and padding around text elements
- **Document responsive behavior**: How text scales on different screen sizes
- **Show code examples**: CSS implementations for each text style

### Usage Guidelines
- **When to use each style**: H1 for page titles, H3 for section headers, etc.
- **Content guidelines**: Maximum line lengths, optimal paragraph sizes
- **Accessibility considerations**: Minimum font sizes, contrast requirements
- **Brand voice alignment**: How typography reinforces your brand personality

## üìè Spacing System Guidelines

### System Foundation
- **Establish base units**: Typically 4px or 8px as the fundamental unit
- **Create multiplicative scale**: 4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, etc.
- **Name consistently**: xs, sm, md, lg, xl or numerical (spacing-1, spacing-2)
- **Document the logic**: Why these specific values were chosen

### Visual Documentation
- **Show actual spacing**: Visual bars or rulers showing relative sizes
- **Include measurements**: Clear labeling of pixel/rem values
- **Demonstrate usage**: Real examples in components and layouts
- **Show responsive behavior**: How spacing adapts to different screen sizes

### Implementation Guidance
- **CSS custom properties**: `--spacing-md: 16px;`
- **Utility classes**: `.margin-lg`, `.padding-sm`
- **Component examples**: How spacing applies to buttons, cards, forms
- **Layout principles**: How spacing creates visual hierarchy and rhythm

### Common Applications
- **Component padding**: Internal spacing within UI elements
- **Layout margins**: Space between major sections
- **Form spacing**: Between form fields, labels, and buttons
- **Content spacing**: Between paragraphs, lists, and headings

## üß© Iconography Guidelines

### Icon System Setup
- **Choose consistent style**: Outline vs. filled, stroke weight, corner radius
- **Establish size system**: 16px, 24px, 32px standard sizes
- **Define usage context**: When to use different sizes and styles
- **Source specification**: Icon library (Heroicons, Feather, etc.) or custom

### Visual Organization
- **Categorize by function**: Navigation, actions, status, social, etc.
- **Show actual icons**: Don't just list icon names
- **Include sizing examples**: Icons at different sizes in context
- **Demonstrate color usage**: How icons inherit or override colors

### Technical Implementation
- **SVG optimization**: Ensure icons are properly optimized for web
- **Accessibility**: Alt text, titles, ARIA labels for screen readers
- **Loading considerations**: Icon fonts vs. SVG sprites vs. individual files
- **Naming conventions**: Consistent naming for development integration

### Usage Guidelines
- **Icon-text relationships**: When to use icons alone vs. with labels
- **Interactive states**: How icons change on hover, focus, active
- **Brand consistency**: How icons align with your overall visual style
- **Cultural considerations**: Icons that might be misunderstood in different contexts

## ü™ü Elevation & Shadow Guidelines

### Shadow System
- **Define levels**: Typically 3-5 levels from flat to floating
- **Show visual hierarchy**: How shadows indicate element importance
- **Include technical specs**: Exact CSS box-shadow values
- **Demonstrate context**: When to use each shadow level

### Visual Examples
- **Side-by-side comparisons**: Show all shadow levels together
- **Real component examples**: Shadows on actual buttons, cards, modals
- **Interactive states**: How shadows change on hover or focus
- **Background considerations**: How shadows look on different backgrounds

### Implementation Details
- **CSS specifications**: Exact box-shadow values for each level
- **Performance considerations**: Efficient shadow rendering
- **Accessibility**: Ensure shadows don't interfere with readability
- **Animation guidelines**: How shadows should transition between states

## üü¶ Border Radius Guidelines

### Radius System
- **Establish scale**: Small (2-4px), medium (6-8px), large (12-16px), full (50% or 9999px)
- **Show visual impact**: How different radii affect component personality
- **Usage guidelines**: When to use sharp vs. rounded corners
- **Brand alignment**: How border radius reflects your product's character

## üí° Design System Success Tips

1. **Start small**: Begin with the most commonly used elements
2. **Get buy-in**: Ensure leadership and team support before starting
3. **Make it practical**: Focus on elements you actually use, not theoretical completeness
4. **Show real examples**: Use actual product content and realistic scenarios
5. **Plan for evolution**: Design systems should grow and change with your product
6. **Collaborate closely**: Design and development should work together from the start
7. **Measure success**: Track adoption, consistency, and development velocity improvements
8. **Document decisions**: Record why choices were made for future reference

Remember: A design system is only successful if it's actually used. Focus on practical utility over theoretical perfection.
