# Service Responsibilities - TaskMaster v1.0

## Purpose
Define clear boundaries and responsibilities for each service/component in the TaskMaster system architecture to ensure clean separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainable code across frontend application and backend services.

## Overview Table

|---------|-------------------------|---------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Web Application (PWA)** | User interface, client-side logic, offline functionality | Backend business logic, data persistence | Frontend Team | Single responsive application |
| **API Gateway** | Request routing, load balancing, authentication | Business logic, data storage | DevOps/Platform Team | Entry point for all requests |
| **Authentication Service** | User auth, session management, access control | Task management, business logic | Backend Team | Security-focused service |
| **Core API Service** | Task CRUD, search, business rules, data validation | User authentication, UI concerns | Backend Team | Main business logic service |
| **Primary Database** | Data persistence, consistency, backup | Business logic, application logic | Database Team | Transactional data storage |
| **Redis Cache** | Performance optimization, session storage | Business logic, permanent storage | Backend Team | In-memory caching |

## Detailed Service Definitions

### Web Application (PWA)
**Summary**: Progressive web application that provides the complete user interface for TaskMaster with cross-platform compatibility and offline functionality.

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Render all UI components (dashboard, forms, charts, modals)
- Handle user interactions and client-side routing
- Implement offline functionality with service workers
- Manage client-side state and local caching
- Provide responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Implement accessibility features (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Handle real-time UI updates

**Non-Responsibilities**:
- Server-side business logic or data validation
- User authentication beyond token management
- Direct database operations
- Cross-device synchronization logic
- Server-side search indexing

**Key Interactions**:
- **Calls**: All backend services via API Gateway
- **Receives**: HTTP responses, authentication tokens, data updates
- **Dependencies**: API Gateway for all backend communication

**Justification**: Single application approach reduces complexity while providing cross-platform compatibility through responsive design and PWA capabilities.

### API Gateway
**Summary**: Central entry point that handles request routing, load balancing, and basic authentication validation for all backend services.

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Route requests to appropriate backend services
- Implement load balancing and basic health checks
- Validate authentication tokens
- Provide rate limiting and basic throttling
- Implement CORS and security headers
- Centralized request/response logging

**Non-Responsibilities**:
- Business logic or domain-specific operations
- Data persistence or database operations
- Complex authentication logic
- Data transformation beyond routing
- User interface concerns

**Key Interactions**:
- **Calls**: Authentication Service, Core API Service
- **Receives**: HTTP requests from web application
- **Dependencies**: Backend services for request routing

**Justification**: Centralizes cross-cutting concerns while keeping the implementation simple and focused on current needs.

---

### Authentication Service
**Summary**: Dedicated service responsible for user authentication, authorization, and session management.

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- User registration and login functionality
- JWT token generation and validation
- Password management and security policies
- Session management and token refresh
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Security audit logging

**Non-Responsibilities**:
- Task management or business logic
- Search functionality or data indexing
- User interface or presentation logic
- Complex business rule validation
- File storage or external integrations

**Key Interactions**:
- **Calls**: Primary Database for user data
- **Receives**: Authentication requests from API Gateway
- **Dependencies**: Primary Database for user storage

**Justification**: Security concerns require specialized focus and isolation from business logic, but kept simple for current requirements.

---

### Core API Service
**Summary**: Main business logic service that handles all task-related operations, search functionality, and core application features.

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Task and subtask CRUD operations
- Business rule validation (due dates, priorities, categories)
- Full-text search functionality across tasks
- Data validation and integrity checks
- Batch operations and bulk updates
- Progress tracking and analytics
- Category and tag management

**Non-Responsibilities**:
- User authentication or session management
- User interface or presentation logic
- Direct database schema management
- Infrastructure concerns
- External service integrations

**Key Interactions**:
- **Calls**: Primary Database for data operations, Redis Cache for performance
- **Receives**: Business requests from API Gateway
- **Dependencies**: Primary Database for persistence, Redis Cache for optimization

**Justification**: Consolidates core business logic into a single service to reduce complexity while maintaining clear separation from authentication and infrastructure concerns.

---

### Primary Database
**Summary**: Transactional database system providing persistent storage for all application data with ACID guarantees.

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Store user accounts and profile data
- Persist task and subtask information
- Maintain data consistency and integrity
- Provide backup and recovery capabilities
- Handle transactions and concurrency
- Support full-text search queries

**Non-Responsibilities**:
- Business logic or validation rules
- Application-level caching
- User interface or presentation logic
- External service integrations
- Authentication logic

**Key Interactions**:
- **Calls**: None (passive storage system)
- **Receives**: Database queries from Authentication Service and Core API Service
- **Dependencies**: Database infrastructure and backup systems

**Justification**: Centralized storage ensures data consistency and simplifies the data architecture for current requirements.

---

### Redis Cache
**Summary**: High-performance in-memory cache providing fast data access and session storage for the application.

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Cache frequently accessed task data
- Store user sessions and temporary data
- Provide fast key-value operations for performance optimization
- Handle cache expiration and eviction policies
- Support search result caching
- Improve API response times

**Non-Responsibilities**:
- Permanent data storage
- Business logic or validation
- Complex data relationships
- Backup and recovery (beyond Redis persistence)
- Search indexing

**Key Interactions**:
- **Calls**: None (passive storage system)
- **Receives**: Cache operations from Core API Service
- **Dependencies**: Redis infrastructure

**Justification**: Performance optimization through caching improves user experience while keeping the caching layer simple and focused.

## Service Interaction Rules

### Data Flow Principles
1. **Request-response flow**: Web application communicates with backend services via API Gateway
2. **Simple communication**: Direct API calls without complex messaging patterns
3. **Single responsibility**: Each service owns its domain without overlap
4. **Service independence**: Services can be deployed and scaled independently

### Cross-Service Communication
- **Web Application** → **API Gateway** → **Backend Services**: All requests flow through gateway
- **Core API Service** → **Authentication Service**: Token validation when needed
- **All Services** → **Database/Cache**: Direct data layer access

### Error Handling Boundaries
- Each service handles its own errors and provides meaningful responses
- API Gateway provides basic error response formatting
- Web application handles user-friendly error presentation
- Database services handle data integrity and recovery

## Scalability and Performance Considerations

### Service Scaling Strategies
- **Stateless services**: Core API Service and Authentication Service can scale horizontally
- **Database scaling**: Read replicas and connection pooling
- **Cache distribution**: Redis clustering for high availability
- **Frontend scaling**: CDN distribution for static assets

### Performance Optimization
- **API Gateway**: Basic request caching and routing optimization
- **Core API Service**: Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- **Database**: Proper indexing for search and query performance
- **Web Application**: Service worker caching for offline capabilities
