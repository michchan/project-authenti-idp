| **API Gateway** | Request routing, load balancing, authentication | Business logic, data storage | DevOps/Platform Team | Entry point for all requests |
| **Authentication Service** | User auth, session management, access control | Task management, business logic | Backend Team | Security-focused service |
| **Core API Service** | Task CRUD, search, business rules, data validation | User authentication, UI concerns | Backend Team | Main business logic service |
| **Primary Database** | Data persistence, consistency, backup | Business logic, application logic | Database Team | Transactional data storage |

## Detailed Service Definitions

### Web Application (PWA)
**Summary**: Progressive web application providing complete TaskMaster UI with cross-platform compatibility and offline functionality.

- Render UI components (dashboard, forms, charts, modals)
- Handle user interactions and client-side routing
- Implement offline functionality with service workers
- Manage client-side state and local caching
- Provide responsive design for all devices
- Implement accessibility features (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Handle real-time UI updates

**Non-Responsibilities**:
- Server-side business logic or validation
- Authentication beyond token management
- Database operations
- Cross-device synchronization
- Server-side search indexing

**Key Interactions**:
- **Calls**: Backend services via API Gateway
- **Receives**: HTTP responses, auth tokens, data updates
- **Dependencies**: API Gateway for backend communication

**Justification**: Single application reduces complexity while providing cross-platform compatibility through responsive design and PWA.

### API Gateway
**Summary**: Central entry point handling request routing, load balancing, and authentication validation for backend services.

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Route requests to backend services
- Implement load balancing and health checks
- Validate authentication tokens
- Provide rate limiting and throttling
- Implement CORS and security headers
- Centralized request/response logging

**Non-Responsibilities**:
- Business logic or domain operations
- Data persistence or database operations
- Complex authentication logic
- Data transformation beyond routing
- User interface concerns

**Key Interactions**:
- **Calls**: Authentication Service, Core API Service
- **Receives**: HTTP requests from web application
- **Dependencies**: Backend services for routing

**Justification**: Centralizes cross-cutting concerns with simple implementation focused on current needs.

---

### Authentication Service
**Summary**: Dedicated service for user authentication, authorization, and session management.

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- User registration and login
- JWT token generation and validation
- Password management and security policies
- Session management and token refresh
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Security audit logging

**Non-Responsibilities**:
- Task management or business logic
- Search functionality or data indexing
- User interface or presentation logic
- Complex business rule validation
- File storage or external integrations

**Key Interactions**:
- **Calls**: Primary Database for user data
- **Receives**: Auth requests from API Gateway
- **Dependencies**: Primary Database for user storage

**Justification**: Security concerns require specialized focus and isolation from business logic, kept simple for current requirements.

---

### Core API Service
**Summary**: Main business logic service handling task operations, search functionality, and core features.

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Task and subtask CRUD operations
- Business rule validation (due dates, priorities, categories)
- Full-text search across tasks
- Data validation and integrity checks
- Batch operations and bulk updates
- Progress tracking and analytics
- Category and tag management

**Non-Responsibilities**:
- User authentication or session management
- User interface or presentation logic
- Database schema management
- Infrastructure concerns
- External service integrations

**Key Interactions**:
- **Calls**: Primary Database for data, Redis Cache for performance
- **Receives**: Business requests from API Gateway
- **Dependencies**: Primary Database for persistence, Redis Cache for optimization

**Justification**: Consolidates core business logic into single service reducing complexity while maintaining separation from authentication and infrastructure.

---

### Primary Database
**Summary**: Transactional database providing persistent storage for application data with ACID guarantees.

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Store user accounts and profile data
- Persist task and subtask information
- Maintain data consistency and integrity
- Provide backup and recovery
- Handle transactions and concurrency
- Support full-text search queries

**Non-Responsibilities**:
- Business logic or validation rules
- Application-level caching
- User interface or presentation logic
- External service integrations
- Authentication logic

**Key Interactions**:
- **Calls**: None (passive storage)
- **Receives**: Database queries from Authentication and Core API Services
- **Dependencies**: Database infrastructure and backup systems

**Justification**: Centralized storage ensures data consistency and simplifies data architecture for current requirements.

---

### Redis Cache
**Summary**: High-performance in-memory cache providing fast data access and session storage.

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- Cache frequently accessed task data
- Store user sessions and temporary data
- Provide fast key-value operations for performance
- Handle cache expiration and eviction policies
- Support search result caching
- Improve API response times

**Non-Responsibilities**:
- Permanent data storage
- Business logic or validation
- Complex data relationships
- Backup and recovery (beyond Redis persistence)
- Search indexing

**Key Interactions**:
- **Calls**: None (passive storage)
- **Receives**: Cache operations from Core API Service
- **Dependencies**: Redis infrastructure

**Justification**: Performance optimization through caching improves user experience while keeping caching layer simple and focused.

## Service Interaction Rules

### Data Flow Principles
1. **Request-response flow**: Web application communicates with backend via API Gateway
2. **Simple communication**: Direct API calls without complex messaging
3. **Single responsibility**: Each service owns its domain without overlap
4. **Service independence**: Services deployed and scaled independently

### Cross-Service Communication
- **Web Application** → **API Gateway** → **Backend Services**: All requests through gateway
- **Core API Service** → **Authentication Service**: Token validation when needed
- **All Services** → **Database/Cache**: Direct data layer access

### Error Handling Boundaries
- Each service handles own errors and provides meaningful responses
- API Gateway provides basic error response formatting
- Web application handles user-friendly error presentation
- Database services handle data integrity and recovery

## Scalability and Performance Considerations

### Service Scaling Strategies
- **Stateless services**: Core API and Authentication Services scale horizontally
- **Database scaling**: Read replicas and connection pooling
- **Cache distribution**: Redis clustering for high availability
- **Frontend scaling**: CDN distribution for static assets

### Performance Optimization
- **API Gateway**: Basic request caching and routing optimization
- **Core API Service**: Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- **Database**: Proper indexing for search and query performance
- **Web Application**: Service worker caching for offline capabilities
