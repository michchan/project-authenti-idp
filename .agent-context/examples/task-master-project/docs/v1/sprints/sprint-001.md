## ðŸ“Œ Sprint Notes
- LocalStorage implementation for task persistence working well for MVP.
- Priority color scheme (High: Red, Medium: Orange, Low: Gray) approved by design team.
- Auto-save functionality exceeded expectations - no user complaints about data loss.
- Team velocity: 2 user stories completed, on track for subsequent sprints.
- Risk: Need to consider scalability for larger task lists in future sprints.
