# Technical Considerations Guidelines

## Overview
Technical Considerations documents capture detailed technical implementation decisions, architecture approaches, and infrastructure requirements that support the system architecture. These documents are created by the System Architect and provide comprehensive technical guidance for development teams.

## Purpose
- Document technical implementation strategies and rationale
- Define performance targets, security measures, and scalability approaches
- Provide guidance for infrastructure setup and monitoring
- Establish technical standards and best practices for the project
- Bridge the gap between high-level architecture and detailed implementation

## When to Create
Technical Considerations documents should be created during Stage 2 (step 7) of the product development workflow, alongside other system design documents. They are particularly important for:
- Complex systems requiring detailed technical guidance
- Projects with specific performance, security, or scalability requirements
- Systems integrating multiple technologies or external services
- Projects where technical decisions significantly impact implementation

## Document Structure

### Required Sections

1. **Purpose**: Brief statement of what this document accomplishes
2. **Architecture Approach**: High-level technical approach and technology choices
3. **Integration Patterns**: How system components communicate and interact
4. **Scalability Considerations**: Performance targets and scaling strategies
5. **Security Implementation**: Security measures, authentication, and data protection
6. **Infrastructure Requirements**: Development and production environment needs
7. **Monitoring & Observability**: Metrics, logging, and alerting approaches

### Optional Sections (as applicable)
- **Migration Strategy**: For systems replacing existing solutions
- **Third-party Integrations**: External service dependencies and configurations
- **Compliance Requirements**: Regulatory or industry standard adherence
- **Cost Optimization**: Strategies for managing infrastructure costs

## Content Guidelines

### Be Specific and Actionable
- ✅ "Use bcrypt with minimum 12 rounds for password hashing"
- ❌ "Use secure password hashing"
- ✅ "API response times should be under 200ms for CRUD operations"
- ❌ "APIs should be fast"

### Include Rationale
Explain why specific technical decisions were made:
- Performance requirements driving technology choices
- Security considerations influencing architecture
- Cost constraints affecting infrastructure decisions
- Team expertise impacting technology selection

### Define Clear Metrics
Establish measurable targets:
- Performance: Response times, throughput, concurrent users
- Security: Encryption standards, token lifetimes, audit requirements
- Scalability: Growth targets, resource limits, scaling triggers
- Reliability: Uptime targets, recovery times, error rates

### Address Trade-offs
Acknowledge and document technical trade-offs:
- Performance vs. security considerations
- Cost vs. scalability decisions
- Complexity vs. maintainability choices
- Feature richness vs. simplicity

## Best Practices

### Technology Selection
- Prefer proven technologies over bleeding-edge options
- Consider team expertise and learning curve
- Evaluate long-term support and community
- Balance features needed vs. complexity introduced

### Performance Planning
- Set realistic performance targets based on business needs
- Plan for both current scale and anticipated growth
- Consider user experience impact of performance decisions
- Include performance testing in validation strategy

### Security by Design
- Implement security measures from the beginning
- Follow industry best practices and standards
- Plan for regular security reviews and updates
- Document security assumptions and threat models

### Infrastructure Planning
- Design for both development and production needs
- Consider monitoring and debugging capabilities
- Plan for disaster recovery and business continuity
- Balance automation with operational simplicity

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming
- Use format: `technical-considerations-[version].md`
- Example: `technical-considerations-1.0.md`

### Version Management
- Create new versions for major architectural changes
- Use incremental versioning (1.0, 1.1, 2.0)
- Maintain change history and rationale

### Cross-References
- Link to related architecture documents
- Reference PRD requirements that drive technical decisions
- Connect to system flows and architecture documentation
- Align with deployment plans and infrastructure designs

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Over-Engineering
- ❌ Designing for theoretical future needs without business justification
- ❌ Adding complexity without clear benefits
- ❌ Choosing technologies based on popularity rather than fit

### Under-Specification
- ❌ Vague performance targets ("should be fast")
- ❌ Generic security measures without specific implementation
- ❌ Missing integration details between components

### Ignoring Constraints
- ❌ Not considering team expertise and available resources
- ❌ Ignoring budget and timeline constraints
- ❌ Overlooking existing system integration requirements

## Review Process
Technical Considerations documents should be reviewed by:
1. **Development Teams**: Feasibility and implementation clarity
2. **DevOps Engineers**: Infrastructure and deployment considerations
3. **Security Expert**: Security implementation and compliance
4. **Product Owner**: Alignment with business requirements and constraints

The System Architect incorporates feedback and updates the document until all stakeholders approve the technical approach.
