# 📘 System architecture guidelines

## 🧭 Purpose
To define the high-level architecture that meets product and UX goals while providing a foundation for scalable, reliable implementation. This file helps align backend, frontend, and DevOps teams around core decisions.

## ✅ Must Include
- Overview of clients, services, databases, external dependencies
- Key decisions about architecture style (monolith vs microservices, etc.)
- High-level data flow and system boundaries
- Communication types: sync/async, protocols, queues, brokers
- Justification for major decisions, including rejected alternatives

## 🤔 Why It Matters
- Prevents misalignment on system shape and scalability
- Reduces risk of incompatible assumptions between teams
- Informs tech stack selection and service decomposition

## 📐 How To Structure It
1. **Context Overview**  
   - Summarize product goals and expected scale
2. **Component Map**  
   - List all major system parts (frontend apps, APIs, DBs, third-party services)
3. **Communication Plan**  
   - Detail how components talk (REST, RPC, events)
4. **Justification Notes**  
   - Why this structure, trade-offs considered
5. **Risks & Uncertainties**  
   - Open questions, assumptions made
6. **Diagrams**  
   - Include Mermaid/system diagrams for clarity

## 🛠 Tips
- When unsure, model with the simplest architecture and evolve
- Include “future evolution” if decisions may change with scale
- Document architectural constraints from stakeholders (e.g., compliance, cost)
