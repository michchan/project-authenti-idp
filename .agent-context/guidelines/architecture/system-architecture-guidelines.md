# 📘 System Architecture Guidelines

## 🧭 Purpose
Define high-level architecture meeting current requirements while remaining extendable and scalable. Focus on present needs, not speculative features. Aligns teams around core decisions.

## ✅ Must Include
- System architecture diagram (frontend, backend, databases, infrastructure)
- Key architectural decisions based on current requirements
- Component interactions and data flow explanation
- Justification for major decisions addressing present needs

## 🤔 Why It Matters
- Prevents misalignment on requirements and boundaries
- Reduces overengineering risk
- Informs tech stack selection
- Ensures architecture addresses actual needs

## 📐 Structure
1. **Context Overview**: Product goals and expected scale
2. **Architecture Diagram**: System components (apps, services, databases, cache)
3. **Architecture Explanation**: Component interactions and data flow

## 🛠 Tips
- Focus on current requirements
- Choose simplest architecture meeting present needs
- Avoid overengineering for hypothetical scaling
- Base decisions on actual needs
- Keep explanations concise
- Document constraints based on stakeholder requirements
