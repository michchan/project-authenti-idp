# 📘 System architecture guidelines

## 🧭 Purpose
To define the high-level architecture that meets current product and UX requirements while remaining extendable and scalable. Focus on present needs rather than speculative future features. This file helps align backend, frontend, and DevOps teams around core decisions.

## ✅ Must Include
- System-level architecture diagram (frontend apps, backend services, databases, infrastructure)
- Key architectural decisions based on current requirements
- Brief explanation of component interactions and data flow
- Justification for major decisions addressing present needs

## 🤔 Why It Matters
- Prevents misalignment on current system requirements and boundaries
- Reduces risk of overengineering for hypothetical future needs
- Informs present tech stack selection and service design
- Ensures architecture addresses actual user and business requirements

## 📐 How To Structure It
1. **Context Overview**  
   - Summarize product goals and expected scale
2. **Architecture Diagram**  
   - System-level architecture diagram focusing on system component/service level (web application, backend services, database, cache instances)
   - Should showcase frontend application and backend services with appropriate complexity
   - Focus on system architecture rather than internal implementation details
3. **Architecture Explanation**  
   - Brief explanation of how components interact, describing the architecture diagram
   - Focus on system-level interactions and data flow

## 🛠 Tips
- Focus on current requirements rather than speculative future needs
- Choose the simplest architecture that meets present requirements while remaining extendable
- Avoid overengineering for hypothetical scaling scenarios
- Base decisions on actual user needs and business requirements
- Keep architecture explanations concise and focused on current system interactions
- Document architectural constraints based on present stakeholder requirements
