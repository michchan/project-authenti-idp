# üìò Deployment Plan Guidelines 

## üß≠ Purpose
Define the high-level deployment strategy, infrastructure approach, and operational procedures without diving into specific implementation details or code.

## ‚úÖ Must Include
- **Strategy Overview**: Architecture type, hosting approach, core requirements
- **Infrastructure Design**: High-level architecture diagrams and component relationships
- **Platform Evaluation**: Hosting options with rationale for choices
- **Pipeline Strategy**: CI/CD approach and deployment workflow
- **Configuration Management**: Environment strategy and security approach
- **Operational Considerations**: Monitoring, disaster recovery, and scaling plans

## ‚ùå Avoid Including
- **Specific Code Implementation**: No actual configuration files, build scripts, or code snippets
- **Detailed Tool Configuration**: High-level tool choices only, not specific settings
- **Step-by-step Instructions**: Strategic approach rather than operational procedures
- **Environment-specific Details**: Focus on patterns and strategies, not specific values

## ü§î Why It Matters
- Provides strategic direction for implementation teams
- Ensures architectural consistency across environments
- Guides technology and platform selection decisions
- Establishes operational frameworks without prescriptive details

## üìê How To Structure It
1. **Deployment Overview**  
   - Architecture type and hosting strategy
   - Core requirements and constraints
2. **Infrastructure Architecture**  
   - High-level component diagram
   - Technology and platform choices
3. **Platform Evaluation**  
   - Hosting options with trade-offs
   - Selection rationale and alternatives
4. **Pipeline Strategy**  
   - Development workflow and CI/CD approach
   - Build and deployment stages
5. **Configuration Approach**  
   - Environment management strategy
   - Security and performance considerations
6. **Operational Strategy**  
   - Monitoring and observability approach
   - Disaster recovery and scaling plans

## üõ† Tips
- **Focus on "what" and "why"** rather than "how"
- **Emphasize strategic decisions** over tactical implementation
- **Include alternatives and trade-offs** for major platform choices
- **Highlight cost, performance, and scalability considerations**
- **Separate MVP requirements** from future expansion plans
- **Use diagrams** to illustrate architecture and workflows conceptually
