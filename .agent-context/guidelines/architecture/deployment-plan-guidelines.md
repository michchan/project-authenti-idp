# 📘 Deployment plan guidelines 

## 🧭 Purpose
Explain how the system is deployed, hosted, monitored, and maintained across environments.

## ✅ Must Include
- Environments (local/dev/stage/prod)
- CI/CD flow and tooling
- Hosting infrastructure (cloud, edge, on-prem)
- Observability (logs, traces, metrics)
- Secrets/configs handling
- Rollback and change management strategy

## 🤔 Why It Matters
- Ensures reproducibility across teams
- Reduces downtime and drift
- Guides future infra automation

## 📐 How To Structure It
1. **Environment Matrix**  
   | Env | Domain | Infra | Data Source | Notes |
2. **CI/CD Flow**  
   - Steps from commit to deploy
   - Tooling (GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, etc.)
3. **Observability**  
   - Where logs and metrics go
   - Dashboards or alerting
4. **Secrets & Configs**  
   - Vaults, env vars, KMS usage
5. **Change Management**  
   - Rollback plan, hotfix policy

## 🛠 Tips
- Mention cost-conscious alternatives
- Highlight which parts are MVP vs later work
- Flag compliance, latency, uptime needs
