# üìò Deployment Plan Guidelines 

## üß≠ Purpose
Define deployment strategy, infrastructure approach, and operational procedures without specific implementation details.

## ‚úÖ Must Include
- **Strategy Overview**: Architecture type, hosting approach, requirements
- **Infrastructure Design**: Architecture diagrams and component relationships
- **Platform Evaluation**: Hosting options with selection rationale
- **Pipeline Strategy**: CI/CD approach and workflow
- **Configuration Management**: Environment strategy and security
- **Operations**: Monitoring, disaster recovery, scaling plans

## ‚ùå Avoid Including
- **Code Implementation**: No configuration files, scripts, or code
- **Detailed Configuration**: High-level choices only, not specific settings
- **Step-by-step Instructions**: Strategic approach, not procedures
- **Environment Details**: Focus on patterns, not specific values

## ü§î Why It Matters
- Provides strategic direction for teams
- Ensures consistency across environments
- Guides technology selection
- Establishes operational frameworks

## üìê Structure
1. **Deployment Overview**: Architecture type, hosting strategy, requirements
2. **Infrastructure Architecture**: Component diagrams, technology choices
3. **Platform Evaluation**: Hosting options, trade-offs, rationale
4. **Pipeline Strategy**: Workflow, CI/CD approach, stages
5. **Configuration Approach**: Environment management, security
6. **Operations**: Monitoring, disaster recovery, scaling

## üõ† Tips
- Focus on "what" and "why" over "how"
- Emphasize strategic over tactical decisions
- Include alternatives and trade-offs
- Highlight cost, performance, scalability
- Separate MVP from future plans
- Use conceptual diagrams
