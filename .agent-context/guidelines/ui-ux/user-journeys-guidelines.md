# üìà User Journey Guidelines

Guidance for creating user journey documentation using ASCII diagrams.

---

## üéØ Purpose & When to Use

**Purpose**: Document user flows with ASCII diagrams to visualize navigation, identify pain points and optimization opportunities.

**When to use**:
- Designing new features or major workflow changes
- Optimizing user flows for better conversion
- Onboarding team members to understand user paths
- Identifying friction points in user experience
- Planning cross-team coordination for complex flows

---

## üß≠ Journey Planning & Research

### Before Creating Flows
- **Research user behavior**: Use analytics, interviews, support tickets
- **Define user goals**: What is the user trying to accomplish?
- **Identify personas**: Different user types may have different paths
- **Gather baseline metrics**: Conversion rates, drop-off points, completion times

### Journey Scope Definition
- **Focus on specific goals**: One complete objective per journey
- **Include entry and exit points**: How users start and end
- **Consider alternative paths**: Not all users follow the happy path
- **Account for error scenarios**: What happens when things go wrong?

---

## üìä ASCII Flow Creation

### Diagram Structure
- **Start with happy path**: Document ideal user journey first
- **Add branching points**: Show where users take different paths
- **Include decision points**: Where users make choices affecting flow
- **Show system states**: Loading, processing, confirmation states

### Symbol Usage
- **Consistent formatting**: Use same symbols throughout flows
- **Clear labeling**: Every step clearly labeled and understandable
- **Logical flow direction**: Use arrows to show progression
- **Group related steps**: Visual grouping for related actions

### Visual Clarity
- **Keep diagrams readable**: Don't fit too much in one diagram
- **Use whitespace effectively**: Make diagrams easy to scan
- **Test in monospace**: Ensure ASCII art displays correctly
- **Break complex flows**: Split long journeys into connected diagrams

## üîç Flow Documentation Standards

### Step-by-Step Details
- **Screen/state descriptions**: What user sees at each step
- **User actions required**: What user does to progress
- **System responses**: How system reacts to actions
- **Time estimates**: Realistic expectations for each step

### Context Information
- **Prerequisites**: Conditions before starting flow
- **User permissions**: Required access level
- **Device considerations**: Mobile vs. desktop differences
- **Browser requirements**: Specific browser features needed

## üö® Pain Points & Optimization

### Identifying Friction
- **Drop-off points**: Where users most commonly exit
- **Confusion points**: Steps users find unclear or difficult
- **Time sinks**: Steps taking longer than necessary
- **Error-prone areas**: Where users frequently make mistakes

### Documentation Strategies
- **Quantify problems**: Use data to show friction impact
- **User quotes**: Include actual user feedback
- **Competitor analysis**: How others handle similar flows
- **Prioritization framework**: Which issues to tackle first

### Optimization Ideas
- **Specific improvements**: Concrete suggestions for reducing friction
- **A/B test opportunities**: Areas for testing different approaches
- **Quick wins**: Low-effort changes with high impact potential
- **Long-term improvements**: Larger changes requiring more planning

## üîß Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Error Scenarios
- **Validation errors**: Form errors, invalid inputs, missing information
- **System errors**: Network issues, server problems, timeouts
- **User errors**: Wrong information, accidental actions, confusion
- **External errors**: Third-party failures, payment processing issues

### Recovery Paths
- **Clear error messages**: What went wrong and how to fix it
- **Alternative options**: Other ways to complete the goal
- **Escalation paths**: When to involve support or manual processes
- **Prevention strategies**: How to reduce error likelihood

### Edge Case Considerations
- **First-time users**: How flow differs for new users
- **Power users**: Shortcuts or advanced options for experienced users
- **Accessibility needs**: How flow works for users with disabilities
- **Low-bandwidth scenarios**: How flow performs on slow connections

---

## üîó Inter-Flow Connections

### Flow Relationships
- **Sequential flows**: One flow leads to another
- **Parallel flows**: Multiple flows happening simultaneously
- **Conditional flows**: Flows branching based on user characteristics/choices
- **Return flows**: How users return to previous states

### Connection Documentation
- **Trigger conditions**: What causes users to move between flows
- **Context preservation**: Information carrying over between flows
- **Navigation patterns**: How users move between product areas
- **State management**: How system state changes affect available flows

---

## üì± Multi-Device Considerations

### Device-Specific Behavior
- **Mobile adaptations**: How flows change on smaller screens
- **Desktop enhancements**: Additional functionality on larger screens
- **Tablet considerations**: Hybrid behaviors for medium screens
- **Cross-device continuity**: Starting on one device, finishing on another

### Input Method Differences
- **Touch vs. mouse**: Different interaction patterns and capabilities
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for all flows
- **Voice control**: How flows work with voice assistants or dictation
- **Gesture support**: Swipe, pinch, and other touch gestures

---

## üìä Metrics & Measurement

### Success Metrics
- **Conversion rates**: Percentage completing the flow
- **Time to completion**: How long flow takes for successful users
- **Error rates**: Frequency of errors at each step
- **Abandonment points**: Where users most commonly exit

### Measurement Strategy
- **Event tracking**: Specific user actions to track in analytics
- **Funnel analysis**: Step-by-step conversion through flow
- **Cohort analysis**: How flow performance changes over time
- **A/B testing**: Controlled experiments to improve performance

### Review Cadence
- **Regular monitoring**: How often to check flow performance
- **Threshold alerts**: When performance drops below acceptable levels
- **Quarterly reviews**: Deeper analysis of flow effectiveness
- **Annual audits**: Comprehensive review and optimization planning

---

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Usability Testing
- **Task-based testing**: Can users complete the flow successfully?
- **Think-aloud protocols**: What users think at each step
- **Time-to-task completion**: How long flow actually takes
- **Error recovery testing**: How users handle mistakes

### Analytics Validation
- **Compare to documentation**: Does behavior match documented flows?
- **Identify deviations**: Where users take unexpected paths
- **Measure impact**: Did flow changes improve intended metrics?
- **Continuous monitoring**: Ongoing validation of flow effectiveness

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Documentation Issues
- **Happy path only**: Not documenting error cases and alternative paths
- **Generic scenarios**: Using theoretical users instead of real personas
- **Stale documentation**: Flows don't match current product
- **Missing context**: Not explaining why users take certain paths

### Research Issues
- **Assumption-based flows**: Creating flows without user research validation
- **Missing edge cases**: Not considering users with different needs/contexts
- **Ignoring analytics**: Not using data to inform flow documentation
- **Single device focus**: Only considering desktop or mobile, not both

### Process Issues
- **No stakeholder review**: Flows created in isolation without team input
- **Poor maintenance**: Flows become outdated as product changes
- **Inconsistent format**: Different team members use different styles
- **Missing metrics**: No way to measure if documented flows are effective

## üí° User Journey Success Tips

1. **Start with real users**: Base flows on user research, not assumptions
2. **Include the messy parts**: Document errors, edge cases, alternative paths
3. **Use actual content**: Real button labels, error messages, screen text
4. **Test with real users**: Validate flows with usability testing
5. **Measure everything**: Track metrics to know if flows work
6. **Keep it current**: Regular updates ensure documentation stays accurate
7. **Make it collaborative**: Include perspectives from design, development, support
8. **Focus on outcomes**: Document what users accomplish, not just clicks
9. **Consider all devices**: How flows work across different screen sizes
10. **Plan for failure**: Always include error handling and recovery paths

Remember: User journeys are living documents. They should evolve as your product and users change. The best journey documentation helps teams make better decisions about improving user experience.
