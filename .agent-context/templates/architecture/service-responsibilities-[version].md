# Service Responsibilities

## Purpose
Define clear boundaries and responsibilities for each service/component in the system architecture to ensure clean separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainable code across frontend application and backend services.

## Overview Table

| Service | Primary Responsibilities | Non-Responsibilities | Ownership | Notes |
|---------|-------------------------|---------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Web Application (PWA)** | User interface, client-side logic, offline functionality | Backend business logic, data persistence | Frontend Team | Single responsive application |
| **API Gateway** | Request routing, load balancing, authentication | Business logic, data storage | DevOps/Platform Team | Entry point for all requests |
| **Authentication Service** | User auth, session management, access control | Task management, business logic | Backend Team | Security-focused service |
| **Core API Service** | Task CRUD, search, business rules, data validation | User authentication, UI concerns | Backend Team | Main business logic service |
| **Primary Database** | Data persistence, consistency, backup | Business logic, application logic | Database Team | Transactional data storage |
| **Redis Cache** | Performance optimization, session storage | Business logic, permanent storage | Backend Team | In-memory caching |

## Detailed Service Definitions

### [Service Name]
**Summary**: [Brief description of the service]

**Primary Responsibilities**:
- [Responsibility 1]
- [Responsibility 2]
- [Responsibility 3]

**Non-Responsibilities**:
- [Non-responsibility 1]
- [Non-responsibility 2]
- [Non-responsibility 3]

**Key Interactions**:
- **Calls**: [Services this service calls]
- **Receives**: [Requests this service receives]
- **Dependencies**: [External dependencies]

**Justification**: [Why this service boundary makes sense]

## Service Interaction Rules

### Data Flow Principles
1. **Request-response flow**: Web application communicates with backend services via API Gateway
2. **Simple communication**: Direct API calls without complex messaging patterns
3. **Single responsibility**: Each service owns its domain without overlap
4. **Service independence**: Services can be deployed and scaled independently

### Cross-Service Communication
- **Web Application** → **API Gateway** → **Backend Services**: All requests flow through gateway
- **Core API Service** → **Authentication Service**: Token validation when needed
- **All Services** → **Database/Cache**: Direct data layer access

### Error Handling Boundaries
- Each service is responsible for handling its own errors
- API Gateway provides centralized error handling and response formatting
- Services emit structured error events for monitoring and debugging
