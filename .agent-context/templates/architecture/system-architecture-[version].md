# System Architecture Overview

## Purpose
Summarize the overall system architecture to help frontend and backend engineers plan their implementation. This should reflect UX/product requirements but remain agnostic to UI-level details.

## Design Goals
- [Example] Modularity
- [Example] Security-first architecture
- [Example] High availability
- [Example] Low operational overhead

> Customize based on your project goals.

## Design Decisions and Justifications

| Decision | Why It Was Made | How It Will Be Implemented |
|----------|------------------|----------------------------|
| [e.g., Use external Auth provider] | [e.g., Offload security complexity] | [e.g., Use Supabase/Auth0/etc.] |
| | | |
| | | |

## Architecture Diagram

> System-level architecture diagram focusing on system component/service level (web application, backend services, database, cache instances). Should showcase frontend application and backend services with simplified architecture.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Client Tier"
        WebApp[Web Application - PWA]
    end
    
    subgraph "Backend Services"
        subgraph "API Layer"
            Gateway[API Gateway]
        end
        
        subgraph "Application Services"
            AuthService[Authentication Service]
            CoreAPI[Core API Service]
        end
        
        subgraph "Data Layer"
            Database[(Primary Database)]
            Cache[(Redis Cache)]
        end
    end
    
    subgraph "Infrastructure"
        CDN[Content Delivery Network]
        Monitoring[Monitoring & Logging]
    end
    
    WebApp --> CDN
    WebApp --> Gateway
    
    Gateway --> AuthService
    Gateway --> CoreAPI
    
    AuthService --> Database
    CoreAPI --> Database
    CoreAPI --> Cache
    
    AuthService --> Monitoring
    CoreAPI --> Monitoring
```

## Component Communication

| Component | Responsibility | Inbound Communications | Outbound Communications |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| [Component Name] | [2-3 sentence description of what this component handles] | • [Service Name] ([Protocol])<br>• [Service Name] ([Protocol]) | • [Service Name] ([Protocol])<br>• [Service Name] ([Protocol]) |
| [Component Name] | [2-3 sentence description] | • [Service Name] ([Protocol]) | • [Service Name] ([Protocol])<br>• [Service Name] ([Protocol]) |

> Use the system architecture diagram and requirements to determine component responsibilities and communication patterns.
