## `[Number]`. `[Flow Name]`

### Flow Purpose
**Goal**: `[What this user journey accomplishes]`

### ASCII Flow Diagram

```
`[Starting Point]`
   |
   v
`<User Decision/Condition?>`
   |
   +---> `[Branch Option A]` --> `[Outcome A]`
   |
   +---> `[Branch Option B]` --> `[Outcome B]`
   |
   v
`[Next Step]`

   v
`[End State]` --> (Leads to: `[Next Flow Name]`)
```

**Format Notes**: 
- Use `<...>` for condition blocks (decisions, validations, checks)
- Use `[...]` for action/state blocks (user actions, system states)
- Put trigger conditions as arrow labels in Inter-Flow Connections section
